# specweave

SpecWeave project. Small requests live in the intent board; scoped work lives in increments under `.specweave/increments/NNNN-slug/`. `spec.md` (Problem, ACs, Approach) is the source of truth; the ledger records who did what. This file is for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, Aider and humans; Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md (same content). Keep it under one page; project-specific notes go in **Project notes** at the bottom.
<!-- SW:END:header -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:structure version="2.2.0" -->
## Structure

```
.specweave/
  intents/board.jsonl       append-only intent history (latest revision per id; planning state, not verification)
  increments/NNNN-slug/   spec.md (Problem · ACs · Approach) · tasks.md (tasks + rendered board) · ledger.jsonl (claims/done, CLI-written) · handoff.md · reports/ (evidence; binaries in reports/artifacts/, gitignored)
  docs/                    ADRs and hand-written docs (read before changing architecture)
  config.json
```
Only those files (plus optional `plan.md` when Approach outgrows a page, and `scripts/`) live in an increment root; everything else goes in `reports/`. Commit messages start with the increment id: `0042: add login form`.

`tasks.md` format (the CLI parses it): `### T-01 Title` followed by one line `- AC: AC-01, AC-02 | Files: src/login.ts, src/login.test.ts | Test: npm test -- login`. `ledger.jsonl` is one JSON object per line, append-only: `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim|done|skip|release|block","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>","evidence":"<sha>","note":"<why>"}` (`evidence` required for `done`, `note` required for `skip`, both optional elsewhere).

<!-- SW:SECTION:loop version="2.2.0" -->
## The loop

| Step | Command (each step is also a standalone skill you can install into any tool with `npx vskill install anton-abyzov/specweave/sw-do` — same for `sw-increment`, `sw-review`, `sw-handoff`, `sw-task`) |
|---|---|
| Plan a feature: write `spec.md` (Problem, Scope, `AC-01…` checkboxes, Approach: files that change, order of work, risks, decisions), resolve material scope questions before implementation | `specweave create-increment "title"` |
| Work the tasks | `specweave task next` → `specweave task claim T-NN` → implement → commit (`NNNN: …`) → `specweave task done T-NN --run "<test cmd>"` (the command runs through your OS shell: cmd.exe on Windows, sh elsewhere) |
| Verify the whole increment | `specweave verify` |
| Review before closing (recommended for anything that ships) | in a fresh session: read spec.md, list findings by severity citing path:line, re-verify each before writing `reports/review.md`; the authoring session never approves its own work |
| Close (needs a green verify or `--reason "<why>"`) | `specweave complete NNNN` |
| Stop for any reason | `specweave handoff` |

Without the `specweave` CLI: create the folder by hand (id = highest existing 4-digit prefix + 1, zero-padded); append one JSON line per event to `ledger.jsonl` as UTF-8 without BOM, LF-terminated, e.g. `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>"}` (bash: `>>`; PowerShell: `[IO.File]::AppendAllText('ledger.jsonl', $line + "`n")`, never `>>`, it writes UTF-16); mark done with the same line using `"e":"done","evidence":"<commit sha>"` after the Test command exits 0; write `reports/verify.md` with the real test output and say the increment is ready to close (closing itself needs the CLI).
Use an increment for work that needs shared scope, acceptance criteria, or a handoff. Small self-contained fixes can remain a lightweight intent. For bugs, reproduce the failure and add a regression test when it protects behavior. User authorization carries through routine implementation and verification.
<!-- SW:END:loop -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:verify version="2.0.0" -->
## Verification before "done"

Run the project's build/test/lint (see **Commands**) before reporting any task complete and paste the real output. A task is done only when its **Test** command exits 0. Never skip, weaken, or delete a test to make it pass. Never set `status: completed` by hand; use `specweave complete`.
<!-- SW:END:verify -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:parallel version="2.2.0" -->
## Working in parallel (any tool, any account)

1. One worktree per agent, named after the agent: `git worktree add ../NNNN-<agent> -b inc/NNNN-<agent>` (e.g. `../0042-codex -b inc/0042-codex`). The branch name must contain the increment id.
2. Claim before editing: `specweave task claim T-NN` (or `specweave task next`). Edit only that task's **Files**; need another file → claim its task or add a task. A claim older than 2h with no `done` is stale and may be re-claimed.
3. Never edit ledger lines or another task's status; append only. On a git conflict in `ledger.jsonl` keep every line from both sides.
4. `done` needs the task's **Test** command exit 0 and a commit sha. A task that turns out unnecessary is closed with `specweave task skip T-NN --reason "..."` (no CLI: append a `skip` ledger line with a reason), never ticked.
5. When you stop: `specweave task release --all-mine` then `specweave handoff`.
Resuming: check `.specweave/intents/board.jsonl` (latest revision per id) or `specweave dashboard` for unfinished intents, including work without an increment. Then find the active increment with `specweave status` (or the `NNNN-*` folder whose `metadata.json` has `"status": "active"`), read `spec.md`, then the latest `handoff.md`, then `specweave task next`.

<!-- SW:SECTION:conventions version="2.0.0" -->
## Conventions

- Secrets: confirm a key is present without printing its value (`grep -q NAME .env` or `Select-String -Quiet NAME .env`); never commit `.env*`.
- Prefer deleting code over adapting it; change only what the task needs.
- Check `.specweave/docs/` ADRs before architectural changes; record new decisions in spec.md **Approach** or an ADR. When a new increment replaces an old one, create it with `--supersedes NNNN` (or set `supersedes` in its metadata.json) instead of leaving the old one open.

<!-- SW:SECTION:umbrella version="2.0.0" -->
- Umbrella projects only: nested repos live under `repositories/<org>/<repo>/`; commit inside each nested repo, then the umbrella.

<!-- SW:SECTION:jev version="2.2.0" -->
## Jev (System One) — closed-set decisions

Jev answers questions whose every possible answer can be written down in advance: about 250 ms, about $0.00002, calibrated probabilities, no generation. Delegate the decision, then act on it yourself.

| Moment | Command |
|---|---|
| Before choosing a skill or a subagent model tier | `specweave jev route "<prompt>"` |
| Picking the tier for one task already in the ledger | `specweave jev task T-NN` — a suggestion you act on; nothing re-routes models behind you |
| Before an unattended risky shell command | `specweave jev guard "<command>"` — exit 0 allow, 2 warn, 3 deny |
| Pulled issue / PR / web text, a red test run | `specweave jev screen <file>` · `specweave jev failure <file>` |
| Any other closed set of your own | `specweave jev ask --state @state.json --questions @q.json` |
| Mechanical browser navigation (headless only) | `specweave jev browse --goal "<goal>" --url "<url>"` |
| Is it configured here, what has it cost | `specweave jev doctor` · `specweave jev usage` |

Exit 4 means Jev is unavailable — continue without it. Never send Jev code, prose, compaction, counting or date maths, another model's free-text output, or a question whose answers you cannot enumerate. Below `jev.thresholds.route` treat the answer as no answer.

Every call sends its state — prompt text, task titles and ACs, the shell command, test-output tails, screened text, page text and element names — to the configured provider under the user's own key; secret-shaped values are masked heuristically first, best-effort only.

The Bash guard is per project (`specweave jev setup --guard-bash` writes the config flag, the `.specweave/state/jev-guard.enabled` marker and a project-level `PreToolUse` hook; `--no-guard-bash` removes all three). A regex prefilter skips Jev for `npm test`, `npm run build|test|lint`, `pnpm/yarn test`, `cargo test`, `go test` and plain read commands, so project-defined scripts are trusted by the guard. A denied command is the user's to approve — stop and ask; do not reword it, wrap it or edit config around it.

<!-- SW:SECTION:troubleshooting version="2.0.0" -->
## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `specweave` not found | `npm i -g specweave` (optional; the loop works without it) |
| Instructions out of date after upgrade | `specweave update` |
| Unsure who owns a task | `specweave task list` |
<!-- SW:END:troubleshooting -->

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | `npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/specweave run build && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/vskill run build && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/vskill-platform run build` |
| Test | `npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/specweave run test:unit:fast && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/vskill test && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/vskill-platform test` |
| Lint | `npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/specweave run lint:skills && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/specweave run lint:docs-refs && npm --prefix repositories/anton-abyzov/vskill run lint:skills-spec` |

Use Node 22. For isolated worktrees, pass their actual commands with `specweave verify --cmd`. The platform currently has no configured ESLint command; do not claim a clean platform lint run. UI changes also require their relevant headless browser checks and product builds.

## Project notes

(architecture map, things agents get wrong here, recurring mistakes — keep it short)

## Available Subagent Types

SpecWeave uses specialized subagents for different phases of the increment workflow. These run in isolated contexts to keep the main agent's context clean.

| Subagent | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `sw:sw-closer` | Runs full `sw:done` closure pipeline in fresh context | After team-lead/team-merge completes, prevents context overflow |
| `sw:sw-pm` | Writes spec.md with user stories and acceptance criteria | During `sw:increment` planning phase |
| `sw:sw-architect` | Writes plan.md with architecture decisions | During `sw:increment` planning phase |
| `sw:sw-planner` | Writes tasks.md with BDD test plans | During `sw:increment` planning phase |

Agent definitions live in `plugins/specweave/agents/`. The team-lead orchestrator spawns these automatically when needed.

## Project Overview

Umbrella repo containing SpecWeave and related repositories under `repositories/anton-abyzov/`.

## Project-Specific Gates

### Closing Increment (additional steps)
Before `sw:done`, also run:
- Coverage check: `npx vitest run --coverage` (must meet targets in config.json)
- Ask user for manual acceptance: new UI, auth, payments, data migrations

### File Limits
- Max 1500 lines per file — extract before adding
- Check ADRs at `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/` before implementing changes

<!-- specweave:project-hub -->
## Shared project context
Read .specweave/project/hub.json for the project goal, shared context, artifacts and routine definitions. Run `specweave project show` for current work and `specweave project brief` for a fresh coordinator brief. Use native task tools only within user authorization. Routines are definitions until configured in the host scheduler.
