# specweave

SpecWeave project. Small requests live in the intent board; scoped work lives in increments under `.specweave/increments/NNNN-slug/`. `spec.md` (Problem, ACs, Approach) is the source of truth; the ledger records who did what. Keep this file under one page; project-specific notes go in **Project notes** at the bottom.
<!-- SW:END:header -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:structure version="2.2.0" -->
## Structure

```
.specweave/
  intents/board.jsonl       append-only intent history (latest revision per id; planning state, not verification)
  increments/NNNN-slug/   spec.md (Problem · ACs · Approach) · tasks.md (tasks + rendered board) · ledger.jsonl (claims/done, CLI-written) · handoff.md · reports/ (evidence; binaries in reports/artifacts/, gitignored)
  docs/                    ADRs and hand-written docs (read before changing architecture)
  config.json
```
Only those files (plus optional `plan.md` when Approach outgrows a page, and `scripts/`) live in an increment root; everything else goes in `reports/`. Commit messages start with the increment id: `0042: add login form`.

`tasks.md` format (the CLI parses it): `### T-01 Title` followed by one line `- AC: AC-01, AC-02 | Files: src/login.ts, src/login.test.ts | Test: npm test -- login`. `ledger.jsonl` is one JSON object per line, append-only: `{"t":"T-01","e":"claim|done|skip|release|block","by":"<tool>@<host>","at":"<ISO>","evidence":"<sha>","note":"<why>"}` (`evidence` required for `done`, `note` required for `skip`, both optional elsewhere).

<!-- SW:SECTION:loop version="2.2.0" -->
## The loop

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Plan a feature (spec.md with ACs + Approach; resolve material scope questions) | `/sw:increment "title"` |
| Work the tasks (claim → implement → commit → done with evidence) | `/sw:do` (loops `specweave task next` / `claim` / `done --run`) |
| Verify the whole increment | `specweave verify` |
| Review before closing (recommended for anything that ships: fresh context, findings cite path:line and are re-verified) | `/sw:review` |
| Close (needs a green verify or `--reason`) | `/sw:done` |
| Stop for any reason (context, tokens, switching tools) | `/sw:handoff` |

Use an increment for work that needs shared scope, acceptance criteria, or a handoff. Small self-contained fixes can remain a lightweight intent. For bugs, reproduce the failure and add a regression test when it protects behavior. User authorization carries through routine implementation and verification.
<!-- SW:END:loop -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:verify version="2.0.0" -->
## Verification before "done"

Run the project's build/test/lint (see **Commands**) before reporting any task complete and paste the real output. `specweave task done T-NN --run "<test cmd>"` refuses a failing command. Never skip, weaken, or delete a test to make it pass. Never set `status: completed` by hand; use `/sw:done`.
<!-- SW:END:verify -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:parallel version="2.2.0" -->
## Working in parallel (any tool, any account)

1. One worktree per agent, named after the agent: `git worktree add ../NNNN-<agent> -b inc/NNNN-<agent>` (e.g. `../0042-claude -b inc/0042-claude`) or `claude --worktree NNNN-<agent>`. The branch name must contain the increment id.
2. Claim before editing: `specweave task claim T-NN` (or `specweave task next`). Edit only that task's **Files**; need another file → claim its task or add a task. A claim older than 2h with no `done` is stale and may be re-claimed.
3. Never edit ledger lines or another task's status; append only. On a git conflict in `ledger.jsonl` keep every line from both sides.
4. `done` needs the task's **Test** command exit 0 and a commit sha. A task that turns out unnecessary is closed with `specweave task skip T-NN --reason "..."`, never ticked.
5. When you stop: `specweave task release --all-mine` then `/sw:handoff`.
Resuming: check `.specweave/intents/board.jsonl` (latest revision per id) or `specweave dashboard` for unfinished intents, including work without an increment. Then find the active increment with `specweave status` (or the `NNNN-*` folder whose `metadata.json` has `"status": "active"`), read `spec.md`, then the latest `handoff.md`, then `/sw:do`.

<!-- SW:SECTION:conventions version="2.0.0" -->
## Conventions

- Secrets: confirm a key is present without printing its value (`grep -q NAME .env` or `Select-String -Quiet NAME .env`); never commit `.env*`.
- Prefer deleting code over adapting it; change only what the task needs.
- Check `.specweave/docs/` ADRs before architectural changes; record new decisions in spec.md **Approach** or an ADR. When a new increment replaces an old one, create it with `--supersedes NNNN` instead of leaving the old one open.
<!-- SW:END:conventions -->

<!-- SW:SECTION:umbrella version="2.0.0" -->
- Umbrella projects only: nested repos live under `repositories/<org>/<repo>/`; commit inside each nested repo, then the umbrella.

## Jev (System One) — closed-set decisions

Jev answers questions whose every possible answer can be written down in advance: about 250 ms, about $0.00002, calibrated probabilities, no generation. Delegate the decision, then act on it yourself.

| Moment | Command |
|---|---|
| Before choosing a skill or a subagent model tier | `specweave jev route "<prompt>"` |
| Picking the tier for one task already in the ledger | `specweave jev task T-NN` — a suggestion you act on; nothing re-routes models behind you |
| Before an unattended risky shell command | `specweave jev guard "<command>"` — exit 0 allow, 2 warn, 3 deny |
| Pulled issue / PR / web text, a red test run | `specweave jev screen <file>` · `specweave jev failure <file>` |
| Any other closed set of your own | `specweave jev ask --state @state.json --questions @q.json` |
| Mechanical browser navigation (headless only) | `specweave jev browse --goal "<goal>" --url "<url>"` |
| Is it configured here, what has it cost | `specweave jev doctor` · `specweave jev usage` |

Exit 4 means Jev is unavailable — continue without it. Never send Jev code, prose, compaction, counting or date maths, another model's free-text output, or a question whose answers you cannot enumerate. Below `jev.thresholds.route` treat the answer as no answer.

Every call sends its state — prompt text, task titles and ACs, the shell command, test-output tails, screened text, page text and element names — to the configured provider under the user's own key; secret-shaped values are masked heuristically first, best-effort only.

The Bash guard is per project (`specweave jev setup --guard-bash` writes the config flag, the `.specweave/state/jev-guard.enabled` marker and a project-level `PreToolUse` hook; `--no-guard-bash` removes all three). A regex prefilter skips Jev for `npm test`, `npm run build|test|lint`, `pnpm/yarn test`, `cargo test`, `go test` and plain read commands, so project-defined scripts are trusted by the guard. A denied command is the user's to approve — stop and ask; do not reword it, wrap it or edit config around it.

<!-- SW:SECTION:troubleshooting version="2.0.0" -->
## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Skills or hooks missing | `specweave doctor`, then `/reload-plugins` (restart if still missing) |
| Instructions out of date after upgrade | `specweave update` |
| Unsure who owns a task | `specweave task list` |
<!-- SW:END:troubleshooting -->

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Build | TODO: not detected — fill in the build command |
| Test | TODO: not detected — fill in the test command |
| Lint | TODO: not detected — fill in the lint command |

If a cell still says TODO, fill it in from `package.json`/`Makefile` and commit; `specweave verify` runs these rows.

(architecture map, things agents get wrong here, recurring mistakes — keep it short)

## Skill Memories

<!-- Auto-captured by SpecWeave reflect. Edit or delete as needed. -->

### Team Lead
- **2026-03-03**: Agents in team contexts should NOT run /sw:done or /sw:grill themselves — team-lead handles centralized closure to prevent context overflow and enable parallel work
- **2026-03-03**: Team-lead MUST activate master increment (set metadata.json status to "active") BEFORE spawning agents. `specweave complete` silently exits on "planned" status — agents don't manage lifecycle transitions. Closure must retry on failure (max 2) rather than skip.

## Project Structure

- **Umbrella repo**: specweave-umb with repos under `repositories/anton-abyzov/`

## Manual Verification Gates

Ask user to manually verify: new UI flows, auth changes, payment flows, data migrations.
