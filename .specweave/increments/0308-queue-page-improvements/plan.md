# Implementation Plan: Queue Page Improvements

<!--
====================================================================
  TEMPLATE FILE - MUST BE COMPLETED VIA ARCHITECT SKILL
====================================================================

This is a TEMPLATE created by increment skill.
DO NOT manually fill in the placeholders below.

To complete this plan, run:
  Tell Claude: "Design architecture for increment [ID]"

This will activate the Architect skill which will:
- Create system architecture diagrams
- Define data models and API contracts
- Document architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Identify technical challenges
