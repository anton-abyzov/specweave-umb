      "issue": "Line `inEdges.get(d.from)` called .get() without using the return value. Comment said 'ensure key exists' but Map.get() doesn't create keys.

      "title": "Cyclic dependency in renderDAG produces silent incorrect output",
      "confidence": 55,
      "reason": "While cycles cause tasks to default to depth 0 (producing visually wrong but non-crashing output), cyclic dependencies in task DAGs are inherently invalid input. The function is called with SpecWeave task data which is validated upstream. Adding cycle detection would add complexity for an input that should never occur. Noted for potential future hardening."
