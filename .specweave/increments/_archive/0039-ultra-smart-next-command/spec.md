## Quick Summary

Enhance the /specweave:next command to be ultra-intelligent, automatically detecting the current workflow phase and orchestrating the entire SpecWeave workflow autonomously. Users can just hit `/specweave:next` repeatedly to move through planning → execution → validation → QA → closure → next increment.

### Vision

Transform SpecWeave from a powerful but manual system into an autonomous workflow orchestrator:
- **Current**: User runs 8+ commands manually (inc → plan → do → validate → done → next)
- **Future**: User runs 1 command repeatedly (/specweave:next → auto-detects phase → auto-executes)

### Key Capabilities

1. **Auto-Detect Workflow Phase**: No increments → spec.md only → plan needed → tasks ready → validation needed → closure ready
2. **Auto-Call Commands**: /specweave:plan, /specweave:do, /specweave:validate, /specweave:qa
3. **Intelligent Suggestions**: Backlog ranking, dependency validation, priority filtering
4. **Autonomous Mode**: --autonomous flag for zero-prompt execution (ship features while you sleep!)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: 95% accuracy, transparent confidence scores, user control

### Business Value

- **40% faster workflows**: 4 minutes manual overhead → 30 seconds automated
- **Better UX**: "What's next?" is one command, not mental overhead
- **Autonomous shipping**: Power users can enable full automation
- **Onboarding**: Beginners don't need to memorize command sequences

### US-011: Auto-Sync Plan and Tasks on Spec Changes (Priority: P1)

**As a** developer who needs to update spec.md after planning
**I want** plan.md and tasks.md to automatically regenerate when spec.md changes
**So that** my implementation artifacts stay synchronized with the specification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] AC-US11-01: Detect when spec.md is modified after plan.md exists
  - ✅ Implemented in `SpecSyncManager.detectSpecChange()`
  - ✅ Compares file modification timestamps (spec.md mtime > plan.md mtime)
  - ✅ Returns `SpecChangeDetectionResult` with timestamps and reason
  - ✅ 14 unit tests passing
- [ ] AC-US11-02: Automatically regenerate plan.md using Architect Agent
  - ❌ TODO: Architect Agent invocation not implemented
  - ❌ Only skeleton code with "not yet implemented" comment
- [ ] AC-US11-03: Automatically regenerate tasks.md based on updated plan.md
  - ❌ TODO: test-aware-planner invocation not implemented
  - ❌ Only skeleton code with "not yet implemented" comment
- [ ] AC-US11-04: Preserve task completion status during regeneration
  - ❌ TODO: Task status mapping logic not implemented
  - ❌ Design exists but no code
- [ ] AC-US11-05: Show clear diff of what changed in plan/tasks
  - ❌ TODO: Diff generation not implemented
- [x] AC-US11-06: User can skip auto-sync with --skip-sync flag
  - ✅ Implemented in `syncIncrement(incrementId, skipSync)` parameter
  - ✅ Returns early with "skipped by user" reason when skipSync=true
  - ✅ Unit tests passing
- [x] AC-US11-07: Hook works in Claude Code (via user-prompt-submit hook)
  - ✅ Integrated in `plugins/specweave/hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh` (+70 lines)
  - ✅ Detects active increment and checks for spec changes
  - ✅ Shows warning message before commands execute
  - ✅ Non-blocking (decision: "approve" with systemMessage)
- [x] AC-US11-08: Instructions in AGENTS.md for non-Claude tools (Cursor, etc.)
  - ✅ Created `AGENTS.md` (500 lines)
  - ✅ Bash/PowerShell detection scripts
  - ✅ Manual regeneration workflows
  - ✅ Status preservation techniques
  - ✅ VS Code/Cursor integration examples
- [x] AC-US11-09: Handle edge cases (spec.md deleted, invalid format, concurrent edits)
  - ✅ Missing spec.md: Returns specChanged=false, reason="does not exist"
  - ✅ Missing plan.md: Returns specChanged=false, reason="planning phase"
  - ✅ Concurrent edits: Uses modification time comparison
  - ✅ All edge cases covered in unit tests
- [x] AC-US11-10: Log sync events to increment metadata
  - ✅ Implemented in `logSyncEvent()` private method
  - ✅ Appends event to `metadata.json` syncEvents array
  - ✅ Keeps only last 10 events (oldest removed)
  - ✅ Logs timestamp, type, modification times, reason
  - ✅ Unit tests passing

**Rationale**:
Spec-driven development means spec.md is the source of truth. When it changes, downstream artifacts (plan.md, tasks.md) must reflect those changes to maintain consistency. This prevents the common problem where spec evolves but implementation follows an outdated plan.

### US-012: Auto-Update AC Status from Task Completion (Priority: P1)

**As a** developer working on SpecWeave increments
**I want** spec.md AC checkboxes to automatically update when related tasks complete
**So that** AC status always reflects actual implementation progress without manual updates

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] AC-US12-01: Detect task completion via **AC**: tag in tasks.md
- [ ] AC-US12-02: Parse spec.md to find corresponding AC checkbox
- [ ] AC-US12-03: Update AC checkbox from [ ] to [x] when all related tasks complete
- [ ] AC-US12-04: Handle partial completion (some tasks done, others not)
- [ ] AC-US12-05: Integrate into post-task-completion hook
- [ ] AC-US12-06: Manual command /specweave:sync-acs to force sync
- [ ] AC-US12-07: Validate AC-task mapping (ensure all ACs have tasks)
- [ ] AC-US12-08: Show diff before updating spec.md
- [ ] AC-US12-09: Rollback capability if user rejects changes
- [ ] AC-US12-10: Log AC status changes to metadata.json

**Rationale**:
Currently, AC checkboxes in spec.md must be updated manually, which:
1. Creates sync drift between tasks.md (source of truth for completion) and spec.md (source of truth for requirements)
2. Wastes developer time on manual checkbox updates
3. Leads to stale ACs showing [ ] when implementation is actually complete
4. Breaks the automation promise of SpecWeave

By automatically syncing AC status from task completion, we ensure spec.md always reflects true progress.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Parse tasks.md to extract **AC**: tags and completion status
2. Build mapping: AC-ID → List of tasks → Overall completion %
3. Parse spec.md to find AC checkboxes
4. Update checkboxes based on task completion
5. Trigger on: task completion hook, /specweave:done validation, manual /specweave:sync-acs

**Edge Cases**:
- AC with no tasks → Keep [ ] (require manual verification)
- AC with partial tasks → Keep [ ] until ALL tasks complete
- Task with multiple ACs → Update all mapped ACs
- AC manually checked → Preserve manual override (log conflict)

**Dependencies**:
- Requires tasks.md to have **AC**: tags (existing pattern)
- Requires spec.md to have AC-ID pattern (existing: AC-US##-##)
