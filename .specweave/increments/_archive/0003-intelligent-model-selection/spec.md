# Intelligent Model Selection - Automatic Cost Optimization

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: SpecWeave uses Claude Sonnet for all operations, resulting in high costs for simple implementation tasks. Users must manually specify `model: "haiku"` to optimize costs.

**User Pain Points**:
- ❌ Using outdated Sonnet 3.5 instead of latest Sonnet 4.5 (quality regression)
- ❌ High AI costs for repetitive implementation work ($0.80 per feature)
- ❌ No visibility into where costs are incurred
- ❌ Manual model selection requires deep knowledge of capabilities
- ❌ No guidance on when to use Haiku vs Sonnet
- ❌ No pre-implementation research (building wrong things)
- ❌ Quality validation too slow/expensive (3 rounds Sonnet)
- ❌ Missing Anthropic's official cost optimization pattern

**Market Context**:
- Anthropic officially recommends **Sonnet 4.5 for planning** and **Haiku 4.5 for execution** (90% performance, 1/3 cost, 2x speed)
- Research-first development prevents wasted implementation work
- Model version policy ensures users always get latest quality/performance

## Solution Overview

**Intelligent Model Selection System** - Automatically routes work to the optimal AI model based on task type, achieving 60-70% cost savings while maintaining quality.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Model Version Policy (NEW - CRITICAL)**
   - ✅ Always use **Sonnet 4.5** (latest) - NEVER Sonnet 3.5
   - ✅ Always use **Haiku 4.5** (latest) - NEVER Haiku 3.0
   - Simple naming: `sonnet`/`haiku`/`opus` → latest versions
   - Automatic upgrades when Anthropic releases new models
   - No manual configuration needed

2. **Research Phase (NEW - GAME CHANGER)**
   - Optional market research before spec generation
   - Uses Haiku 4.5 (15 min, ~$0.02 - cheap!)
   - Prevents wasted work on saturated markets
   - Informs better specs (research-driven vs guesswork)
   - Enables "research-only" mode (validate ideas without coding)

3. **Automatic Model Selection**
   - System intelligently chooses Sonnet (planning) vs Haiku (execution)
   - Based on agent type, work phase, and task complexity
   - No user intervention required

4. **Cost Visibility**
   - Real-time cost tracking per increment, agent, and phase
   - Savings calculations vs baseline (all-Sonnet)
   - ROI reporting for AI investments

5. **Multi-Phase Orchestration**
   - Complex tasks auto-split: Sonnet plans → Haiku executes → Sonnet validates
   - Transparent phase transitions
   - Quality gates between phases

6. **Quality Validation Optimization (NEW)**
   - Validation uses Haiku 4.5 (not Sonnet)
   - 2 rounds default (down from 3)
   - 67% time savings, 73% cost savings
   - Strict mode available for critical specs

7. **User Control**
   - Three modes: Auto (default), Balanced (approval), Manual
   - Override capability for any task
   - Configurable cost policies

## Out of Scope (Future Increments)

### Deferred to Later
- ❌ Opus model support (focus on Sonnet/Haiku only)
- ❌ Cost prediction before execution (ML model required)
- ❌ Team-level cost analytics dashboard (web UI)
- ❌ Integration with cloud billing APIs
- ❌ Cost optimization for MCP servers

### Explicitly Not Included
- ❌ Support for non-Anthropic models (OpenAI, etc.)
- ❌ Real-time model switching mid-task
- ❌ A/B testing framework for model comparison
- ❌ Cost-based task prioritization

## Technical Constraints

### Must Maintain
- ✅ Current Task tool API (backward compatible)
- ✅ Manual model override capability
- ✅ All existing agent/skill functionality

### Must Avoid
- ❌ Breaking existing user projects
- ❌ Requiring configuration for basic usage
- ❌ Hidden cost charges (full transparency required)
- ❌ Quality degradation below 90% threshold

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Haiku quality insufficient** → Mitigation: Automatic fallback to Sonnet
2. **Phase detection inaccurate** → Mitigation: Explicit logging, user override
3. **Cost tracking overhead** → Mitigation: Async logging, minimal instrumentation

### Medium Risks
1. **User confusion about models** → Mitigation: Clear documentation, transparent logs
2. **Cost savings overpromised** → Mitigation: Conservative estimates (60% vs 70%)

### Low Risks
1. **Agent classification errors** → Mitigation: Easy to update agent preferences
2. **Budget policy too restrictive** → Mitigation: Configurable, default generous

## Appendix: Anthropic Official Guidance

**From Anthropic Video Transcript**:
> "The big pattern we're seeing from our community is that **Sonnet 4.5 does the high-level problem decomposition and planning**, and then **Haiku 4.5 is used to actually implement and write the code**. This multi-agent approach is becoming really popular for things like large-scale refactors or tackling technical debt."

**Performance**: Haiku 4.5 achieves **90% of Sonnet 4.5's performance** in agentic coding evaluations.

**Cost**: Haiku is **1/3 the cost** ($1 vs $3 per million input tokens).

**Speed**: Haiku is **2x faster** than Sonnet.

**Conclusion**: This increment implements Anthropic's official recommendation as an automatic, transparent system.
