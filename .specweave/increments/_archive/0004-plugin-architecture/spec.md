# Product Specification: Plugin Architecture

**Increment**: 0004-plugin-architecture
**Title**: Plugin Architecture - Modular, Context-Efficient, Multi-Tool Support
**Status**: Planning
**Priority**: P0 (Foundation for v0.4.0)
**Created**: 2025-10-31

---

## Executive Summary

Transform SpecWeave from a monolithic skill/agent bundle into a **modular plugin architecture** that:
- Reduces context usage by 60-80% (only load what you need)
- Enables community contributions (publish to Anthropic's marketplace)
- Maintains multi-tool support (Claude, Cursor 2.0, Copilot, Generic)
- Preserves Claude Code's superiority (native hooks, auto-activation, MCP)

**Core Insight**: SpecWeave currently loads 44 skills + 20 agents + 18 commands for EVERY project, even if they never touch Kubernetes or ML. Plugin architecture makes SpecWeave contextually lightweight while remaining feature-rich.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State (v0.3.7)

**Context Bloat**:
- Every project loads ALL 44 skills, regardless of need
- Kubernetes skills loaded for React-only projects
- ML ops agents loaded for static sites
- Figma skills loaded for backend-only APIs

**No Extensibility**:
- Users can't add custom domain plugins
- Community can't contribute specialized skills
- All features must be in core (monolithic)

**Tool Parity Issues**:
- Documentation doesn't emphasize Claude Code's superiority
- Users don't understand why hooks matter (automated living docs)
- Competing tools like Kiro claim "automated docs" when SpecWeave already does this BETTER

### User Pain Points

**User Story 1: Simple Backend API**
> "I'm building a Node.js API with no frontend. Why is SpecWeave loading React skills, Figma skills, and Kubernetes agents? My context is bloated."

**User Story 2: ML Engineer**
> "I need SpecWeave's increment workflow, but I also need specialized ML ops skills. Can I add custom plugins without forking the entire framework?"

**User Story 3: Team Lead**
> "We're using Cursor 2.0, not Claude Code. The docs don't explain what features we're missing (like automated hooks). We manually update docs and wonder why it's not automatic."

**User Story 4: Kiro User**
> "I'm using Kiro for automated living docs. Why should I switch to SpecWeave? Doesn't Kiro do the same thing?"

---

---

### US-015: GitHub-First Task-Level Synchronization

**As a** SpecWeave team member
**I want** each task to sync as a separate GitHub issue
**So that** we can assign tasks individually, track progress granularly, and use GitHub Projects effectively

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ tasks.md enhanced with GitHub Issue, Assignee, Subtasks, Dependencies, Blocks fields
- ✅ `/specweave:github:sync-tasks` command creates GitHub issues per task
- ✅ Each task = 1 GitHub issue (linked to epic)
- ✅ Subtasks represented as checkboxes in issue body
- ✅ Dependencies linked via GitHub issue links (blocks/depends-on)
- ✅ `/specweave:do` closes task issue and updates epic on completion
- ✅ Subtask completion syncs to GitHub checkboxes
- ✅ Rate limiting handled gracefully (batch with delays)
- ✅ ADR-0007 documents GitHub-first architecture decision
- ✅ Public guide explains GitHub integration for users

**User Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Create increment
/specweave:inc "0005-user-authentication"

# 2. Sync tasks to GitHub (creates epic + task issues)
/specweave:github:sync-tasks 0005
# Creates: Milestone v0.5.0, Epic #100, Task Issues #101-#115

# 3. Assign tasks in GitHub
# Team members assign themselves to issues

# 4. Work on tasks
/specweave:do
# Closes GitHub issue #101, updates epic #100 progress

# 5. Team tracks progress in GitHub Projects
# Kanban board shows task cards, dependencies, assignees
```

**Tasks**: T-024-C through T-024-H (Phase 2.5)

**Priority**: P0 (SpecWeave dogfoods this!)

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics

**Context Reduction**:
- Target: 60-80% reduction in loaded skills/agents for typical projects
- Measurement: Compare token usage before/after (simple React app)
- Before: 44 skills + 20 agents ≈ 50K tokens
- After: 10 core + 2 plugins ≈ 15K tokens

**Detection Accuracy**:
- Target: >= 90% accuracy for auto-detection
- Measurement: Test on 50 diverse projects (React, Node, K8s, ML, etc.)
- Success: Correctly suggests relevant plugins 9/10 times

**Plugin Installation Speed**:
- Target: < 2 seconds to enable a plugin
- Measurement: Time from `specweave plugin enable kubernetes` to ready

### Adoption Metrics

**Marketplace Downloads**:
- Target: 100+ downloads per plugin in first month
- Measurement: GitHub releases download count

**Community Contributions**:
- Target: 3+ community-contributed plugins in first 6 months
- Measurement: Pull requests to marketplace repo

**User Satisfaction**:
- Target: "Plugin system is intuitive" (>= 4/5 rating)
- Measurement: User survey after v0.4.0 release

---

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### v0.4.0 Will NOT Include:

1. **Plugin Versioning** - All plugins match framework version (v0.4.0)
   - Future: Semantic versioning per plugin (v1.2.0)

2. **Plugin Dependency Resolution** - No automatic dependency graph
   - Future: Plugin A can require Plugin B

3. **Hot Reloading** - Plugins load at increment/task boundaries, not mid-conversation
   - Future: Explore real-time plugin swapping

4. **Plugin Sandboxing** - No security isolation between plugins
   - Future: Permission model (read-only, write, execute, network)

5. **Plugin Analytics** - No usage tracking or telemetry
   - Future: Opt-in analytics for plugin usage patterns

6. **Multi-Language Support** - Plugins are Markdown/YAML only (English)
   - Future: i18n for plugin descriptions

## Competitive Analysis

### SpecWeave + Claude Code vs. Competitors

| Feature | SpecWeave (Claude) | Kiro | Cursor Composer | Copilot |
|---------|-------------------|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Living Docs (Automated)** | ✅ Native hooks | 🟡 Manual sync | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual |
| **Auto-Activation** | ✅ Skills auto-fire | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Multi-Agent Isolation** | ✅ Separate contexts | ❌ No | 🟡 8 parallel | ❌ No |
| **Slash Commands** | ✅ Native | ❌ No | 🟡 Team commands | ❌ No |
| **Hooks (Pre/Post)** | ✅ Native | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **MCP Protocol** | ✅ Native | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Plugin System** | ✅ This increment | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Context Efficiency** | ✅ 60-80% reduction | 🟡 Unknown | 🟡 @ shortcuts | 🟡 @ workspace |
| **Spec-Driven Workflow** | ✅ Core feature | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**Key Differentiators**:
1. **Automated Living Docs**: SpecWeave + Claude Code updates docs ON EVERY TASK via hooks. Kiro requires manual sync. Cursor/Copilot have no concept of living docs.

2. **True Multi-Agent**: Claude Code's agents have isolated contexts. Cursor's 8 agents share context. Copilot has no agents.

3. **Context Efficiency**: Plugin architecture means SpecWeave only loads what you need. Competitors load everything or nothing.

4. **Spec-Driven Philosophy**: SpecWeave is built around increments (spec → plan → tasks → tests). Competitors are ad-hoc coding assistants.

### Why Claude Code is Best-in-Class

**Anthropic Sets Standards**:
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Industry standard for context management
- Skills - Proven pattern for auto-activating capabilities
- Agents - Proven pattern for role-based, isolated workflows
- Hooks - Proven pattern for lifecycle automation

**SpecWeave Leverages These Standards**:
- Native MCP integration = superior context loading
- Skills auto-activate = no manual invocation
- Agents with isolation = clean separation of concerns
- Hooks = guaranteed automated docs (vs. Kiro's manual approach)

**Result**: SpecWeave + Claude Code = **10x better developer experience** than any competitor.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Breaking Changes for Existing Users

**Risk**: Users on v0.3.7 will have ALL skills in core. Upgrading to v0.4.0 changes structure.

**Mitigation**:
- Migration script: `specweave migrate:v0.4.0`
- Detects current project, suggests plugins to enable
- One-click migration: "Enable all previously available features? (Y/n)"
- Changelog clearly documents breaking changes
- Support both old and new structure for 1 release cycle (v0.4.0 compatibility mode)

### Risk 2: Plugin Discovery (Users Don't Know What's Available)

**Risk**: Users don't know which plugins exist or what they do.

**Mitigation**:
- `specweave plugin search <keyword>` - Search marketplace
- Rich descriptions in `specweave plugin list`
- Documentation page: "Available Plugins" with use cases
- Auto-suggestions during `/specweave:inc` (spec analysis)

### Risk 3: Cursor/Copilot Users Feel Second-Class

**Risk**: Documentation emphasizes Claude Code, making other users feel unsupported.

**Mitigation**:
- Clear "Feature Comparison Matrix" showing what each tool gets
- Positive framing: "Cursor gets AGENTS.md + team commands (85% of Claude experience)"
- Dedicated guides: "Best Practices for Cursor Users"
- Emphasize: "SpecWeave works with any tool, optimized for Claude"

### Risk 4: Plugin Conflicts (Duplicate Skills)

**Risk**: Two plugins provide similar skills, causing confusion.

**Mitigation**:
- Namespacing: `kubernetes:deployer` vs `cloud:deployer`
- Dependency checking: Warn if plugins overlap
- Manifest validation: Reject duplicate skill names at publish
- Documentation: "Recommended Plugin Combinations"

### Risk 5: Marketplace Maintenance Burden

**Risk**: Publishing to Anthropic marketplace requires ongoing maintenance.

**Mitigation**:
- Automated CI/CD for marketplace repo
- Plugin publish script: `specweave plugin publish kubernetes`
- Semantic versioning: Match SpecWeave framework version
- Community moderation: Accept community PRs for plugin updates

---

## Future Enhancements (v0.5.0+)

### Plugin Versioning
- Plugins have independent versions (kubernetes@1.2.0)
- `specweave plugin update kubernetes` - Update single plugin
- Compatibility matrix: Which plugins work with which SpecWeave versions

### Plugin Dependencies
- Automatic dependency graph resolution
- `kubernetes` plugin requires `cloud-infrastructure` plugin
- One-click install: "kubernetes needs cloud-infrastructure. Install both? (Y/n)"

### Plugin Permissions
- Read-only plugins (documentation, guides)
- Write plugins (generate code, modify files)
- Execute plugins (run commands, deploy)
- Network plugins (API calls, webhooks)

### Hot Reloading
- Load/unload plugins mid-conversation (Claude Code native)
- Context switch optimization (swap plugins without losing state)

### Plugin Analytics
- Opt-in telemetry: Which plugins are most used?
- Insights: "Projects with kubernetes plugin have 40% higher increment completion rate"
