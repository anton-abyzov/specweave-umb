# Increment 0008: User Education & FAQ Implementation

**Status**: completed (scope reduced)
**Type**: feature
**Created**: 2025-11-04
**Completed**: 2025-11-11
**Related**: Increment 0007 (Smart Increment Discipline)
**Scope Change**: Core clarification document (SPECS-ARCHITECTURE-CLARIFICATION.md) created. Full FAQ implementation deferred to future increment.

---

## Summary

Implement comprehensive user education materials to address confusion about SpecWeave's two-spec architecture (Living Docs vs Increment Specs). Create FAQ page, diagrams, flowcharts, and enhance PM agent validation to guide users toward correct usage patterns.

**Links to Living Docs**: N/A (no permanent spec needed - focused enhancement)

---

## Motivation

### The Problem

**User Confusion Identified**:
- "Why do I have specs in two places?"
- "Which spec is the source of truth?"
- "Do I need both for every feature?"
- "Can I delete increment specs after completion?"

**Evidence**:
- Session 2025-11-04: User requested "ultrathink on it" and "maybe in public docs we should have a section, FAQ"
- SPECS-ARCHITECTURE-CLARIFICATION.md created (500+ lines) to address confusion
- FAQ-SECTION-PLAN.md created with 8 critical questions
- Judge LLM assessment revealed design is sound but needs better user education

### The Opportunity

**User Education Gap**: While the two-spec architecture is well-designed, users lack:
1. **Quick reference** - FAQ page answering common questions
2. **Visual aids** - Diagrams showing architecture and decision flowcharts
3. **Proactive guidance** - PM agent suggestions for when to create living docs specs
4. **Clear workflow** - Updated Mermaid diagrams reflecting current workflow

### Success Criteria

**User Success** (measurable):
- ✅ Users correctly create living docs specs for major features only (3+ increments)
- ✅ Users correctly use increment specs for focused work
- ✅ Reduced confusion (tracked via GitHub issues, Discord questions)
- ✅ Increased clarity (tracked via FAQ page views, user surveys)

**Technical Success** (deliverables):
- ✅ FAQ page with 8+ questions published
- ✅ 2+ diagrams (architecture, decision flowchart)
- ✅ PM agent validation for large features
- ✅ Updated user onboarding flow
- ✅ Corrected main workflow diagram

## Technical Constraints

### TC-001: Backward Compatibility

**Constraint**: Changes must not break existing SpecWeave projects

**Implications**:
- PM agent suggestions are non-blocking (users can skip)
- Existing increments continue to work (no migration needed)
- FAQ is additive (no changes to existing workflow)

---

### TC-002: Technology Stack

**Constraint**: Use existing SpecWeave technology stack

**Stack**:
- Docusaurus 3.x for FAQ page
- Mermaid for diagrams (GitHub/Docusaurus compatible)
- Markdown for all documentation
- TypeScript for PM agent validation logic

---

### TC-003: Performance

**Constraint**: PM agent validation must not slow down increment creation

**Requirements**:
- Validation runs < 500ms
- No external API calls (local analysis only)
- Lightweight heuristics (not AI-powered)

---

## Out of Scope (Explicitly NOT Included)

4. **Interactive Diagrams** - Clickable, zoomable diagrams (future: 0012)
5. **AI-Powered Feature Size Estimation** - ML model predicting increment count (future: 0013)
6. **Mandatory Living Docs Specs** - Design principle: Keep optional (never)
7. **Auto-Create Living Docs Specs** - User decision, not auto (never)

### Deferred to Future Increments

1. **FAQ Analytics** - Track views, searches, popular questions (future: 0014)
2. **User Surveys** - Collect feedback on FAQ clarity (future: 0015)
3. **Contextual Help** - In-CLI help messages (future: 0016)
4. **Workflow Validation Tool** - CLI command to validate increment structure (future: 0017)
