  "abandonedReason": "Foundation code (security-scanner.ts, registry-schema.ts, registry.json) shipped. Brand direction pivoted from 'Skill Fabric' docs branding to verified-skill.com product identity in 0217. YouTube NL notes superseded by 0217 T-017 supply chain risk section. Only orphan: README natural-language-UX rewrite (standalone task, not increment-worthy).",
