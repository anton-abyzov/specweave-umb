  "notes": "Fix already applied: registerMarketplace() called with git URL instead of tmpDir. JSDoc updated, parameter renamed to 'source'. All 638 tests pass. TC-004 in add.test.ts validates registerMarketplace called with 'https://github.com/owner/repo'. claude-cli.test.ts covers owner/repo shorthand and HTTPS URL formats."
