<!-- Project-specific learnings for this skill -->

## Learnings

- **2026-03-01**: When designing new adapter systems, first audit existing adapter patterns in codebase - reuse existing ProviderAdapter interfaces and infrastructure rather than creating parallel systems
- **2026-03-01**: When proposing schema changes, use ASCII table format (showing columns, types, relationships) rather than Prisma model code or prose descriptions for clearest comparison of alternatives
