# Questions for CTO

*Auto-generated by Intelligent Analyzer*

1. We found 11 cases where different repos use different patterns for the same thing. Should we standardize?
2. Organization question: Team boundaries are hypothetical - this appears to be a single-team monorepo project. The team structure represents logical ownership domains rather than actual separate teams.
3. Organization question: The 'microservices' classification is architectural potential rather than actual deployment - currently all modules are part of a monolithic CLI application.
4. Organization question: The external project info (Jira/ADO specs for FS-136, FS-137) suggests active development on process lifecycle testing and per-project enforcement, but team ownership of these features is unclear.
5. Organization question: The adapters module suggests multi-tool support is a strategic direction, but current implementation may primarily target Claude Code with other adapters in various stages of completion.
6. Organization question: The hooks module's cross-platform focus suggests Windows support is important, but the primary development appears macOS-focused based on notification patterns in CLAUDE.md.
7. Organization question: The templates module's extensive IaC templates (Terraform, Kubernetes, serverless) may indicate planned infrastructure-as-code generation features not fully integrated with the core workflow.
8. Organization question: The separation between 'integrations' (API clients) and 'sync' (coordination) vs 'importers' (ETL) suggests a deliberate architectural boundary, but actual coupling may be tighter in practice.
