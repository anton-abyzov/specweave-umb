### Backlog & Research Items

**🔬 Community Integration Research**
- **Subagents Library**: Evaluate [awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents) for extending existing agents
  - Goal: Identify high-value subagents that complement current agent roster
  - Consider: Database specialists, API integrators, documentation generators
  - Effort: 2-3 weeks research + integration

- **Official Skills Repository**: Review [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) for reusable components
  - Goal: Adopt official patterns and best practices
  - Priority: Official Anthropic skills may have better maintenance/compatibility
  - Effort: 1-2 weeks evaluation

- **Community Skills Catalog**: Explore [awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills) for domain-specific expertise
  - Goal: Identify specialized skills (e.g., blockchain, ML, mobile dev)
  - Strategy: Create adapter layer for non-SpecWeave skills
  - Effort: 2-4 weeks (depends on skill complexity)

**🚀 /do Command Enhancement**
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Implement wave-based parallel execution for large increments (40+ tasks)
  - Expected speedup: 40-60% for multi-file, independent tasks
  - Dependencies: Smart dependency graph analysis, consolidated hooks
  - Risk: Medium (file conflicts, race conditions)
  - Effort: 3-4 weeks
