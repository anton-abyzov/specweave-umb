## OpenClaw Agent Setup

For multi-project development, we use a **thread-based agent pattern** instead of per-person identity files. See **[OpenClaw: Optimal Agent Workflow](guides/openclaw-optimal-workflow.md)** for the full guide.

**Quick summary**: Project agents = working_folder + skills + tools (no identity needed). Role agents (marketing, social media) = identity + personality + skills + tools.

## Six Core Folders

### 1. Strategy - The "Why"
**Location**: `strategy/`

**Purpose**: Business rationale, vision, and success metrics

**What Goes Here**:
- Vision, Business Case, OKRs
- PRD (Problem, Outcomes, Scope)
- Stakeholder mapping
- Market analysis

**Document Types**:
- PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Vision documents
- OKR documents
- Business case analyses

**When to Use**: When defining the business case for a new product, feature, or initiative

**See**: [strategy/README](strategy/README)

---

### 2. Specs - The "What" (Detailed Requirements)
**Location**: `specs/`

**Purpose**: Detailed technical specifications for features, integrations, and architectural changes

**What Goes Here**:
- Feature specifications (detailed user stories, acceptance criteria)
- Integration proposals (GitHub, JIRA, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Breaking changes and migrations
- Cross-cutting concerns

**Document Types**:
- SPEC-XXXX: Feature specifications
- Must reference ADRs and diagrams when applicable

**When to Use**: When planning complex features requiring team alignment

**IMPORTANT**: Specs serve as the project's historical record. Reading all specs should give a complete understanding of how the project evolved and its current scope.

**Terminology Note**: Renamed to "Specs" in v0.8.0 to align with SpecWeave brand and industry standard.

**See**: [specs/README](specs/README)

---

### 3. Architecture - The "How" (Technical Design)
**Location**: `architecture/`

**Purpose**: System architecture, technical decisions, and data models

**SpecWeave adopts the C4 model** for architecture documentation:

| Document Type | C4 Levels | Purpose | Audience |
|---------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **HLD** | Levels 1-2 | System context, containers (apps, services, DBs) | All technical stakeholders |
| **LLD** | Level 3 | Component internals (controllers, services, repos) | Developers, tech leads |
| **ADR** | Any | Architecture decisions with rationale | All stakeholders |

**What Goes Here**:
- **HLD (High-Level Design)** - System-level design (C4 Levels 1-2)
  - Context diagrams: System → External systems
  - Container diagrams: Web App → API → Database
- **LLD (Low-Level Design)** - Component-level design (C4 Level 3)
  - Component diagrams: Controller → Service → Repository
  - Sequence diagrams: Method-level flows
- **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)** - Technical decisions
- **Data model documentation** - ERDs, schemas
- **Security architecture** - Security model, auth flows

**Subdirectories**:
- `adr/` - Architecture Decision Records (0001-xxx.md)
- `diagrams/` - Mermaid diagrams, SVGs

**When to Use**:
- **HLD**: System has external boundaries, multiple services/components
- **LLD**: Service has complex internal structure, needs design before implementation
- **Not needed**: Simple CRUD services, thin API wrappers

**See**: [architecture/README](architecture/README)

### 4. Delivery - The "How We Build"
**Location**: `delivery/`

**Purpose**: How we plan, build, and release features

**What Goes Here**:
- Roadmap (feature timeline, priorities)
- Release plans (version planning, release notes)
- Test strategy (testing approach, coverage goals)
- CI/CD documentation (build pipelines, deployment processes)
- Branching strategy (Git workflow, branch policies)
- Code review standards (PR review guidelines)

**When to Use**: When planning releases, defining workflows, or tracking engineering performance

**See**: [delivery/README](delivery/README)

### 5. Operations - The "How We Run"
**Location**: `operations/`

**Purpose**: How we operate, monitor, and maintain the system in production

**What Goes Here**:

- Monitoring & Alerting (what to monitor, alert thresholds)
- Incident response (how to handle incidents)
- On-call procedures (rotation, escalation)
- Capacity planning (resource forecasting, scaling)
- DR/BCP (Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plans)
- Performance tuning (optimization guides)

**Document Types**:
- `runbook-{service}.md` - Operational procedures
- `slo-{service}.md` - SLO definitions
- `incident-response.md` - Incident handling

### 6. Governance - The "Guardrails"
**Location**: `governance/`

**Purpose**: Security, compliance, and change management policies

**What Goes Here**:
- Security policies (security model, authentication, authorization)
- Privacy policies (data privacy, GDPR, user consent)
- Compliance documentation (HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
- Data retention policies (how long data is kept, deletion procedures)
- Vendor risk management (third-party security assessments)
- Approval processes (who approves what)
- Audit trails (what's logged, retention)
- Change management (how changes are approved and deployed)
- Coding standards (style guide, best practices)

**Document Types**:

## Creating New Documents

1. Choose the appropriate pillar (Strategy, Specs, Architecture, Delivery, Operations, Governance)
2. Use the appropriate template from `templates/docs/`
3. Follow naming conventions:
   - ADR: `0001-decision-title.md`
   - Spec: `spec-0001-feature-title.md`
   - Others: `descriptive-name.md`
4. Create PR for review

## Cross-References and Relationships

### Document Flow

```
PRD → Spec → Architecture → Delivery → Operations
 ↓      ↓         ↓            ↓          ↓
Why  → What →    How   →     Build  →   Run
```

**Example Flow**:
1. **Strategy**: `prd-user-auth.md` - Why do we need authentication?
2. **Specs**: `spec-0005-authentication.md` - What exactly will we build? (user stories, acceptance criteria)
3. **Architecture**: `hld-auth-system.md` - How will it be designed?
4. **Architecture/ADR**: `0012-use-oauth2.md` - Why OAuth2 over other methods?
5. **Delivery**: `test-strategy-auth.md` - How will we test it?
6. **Operations**: `runbook-auth-service.md` - How do we operate it?
7. **Governance**: `security-policy.md` - Security requirements

### Cross-Linking Rules

- ✅ **Spec → ADR**: Link to relevant architecture decisions
- ✅ **Spec → Diagrams**: Reference architecture diagrams
- ✅ **HLD → ADR**: Link to decisions that shaped the design
- ✅ **Runbook → HLD**: Link to system architecture
- ✅ **Test Strategy → Spec**: Link to feature specs being tested

**Example (in Spec)**:
```markdown
## Architecture

See [ADR-0012: Use OAuth2](../architecture/adr/0012-use-oauth2) for authentication method decision.
