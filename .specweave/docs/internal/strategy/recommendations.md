*Auto-generated by Intelligent Analyzer*

## REC-001: Address high-priority modernization candidates

7 repositories need immediate attention: templates, locales, generators, id-generators, validators, progress, testing

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | high |
| Effort | large |
| Category | architecture |

## REC-002: Launch documentation improvement initiative

11 repos have documentation issues. Consider a team-wide doc sprint.

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | medium |
| Effort | medium |
| Category | process |

## REC-003: Improve health of critical domains

2 business domains have low health scores: Documentation Domain (40%), Development Operations Domain (50%)

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | high |
| Effort | medium |
| Category | architecture |

## REC-004: Clarify team ownership and boundaries

Organization analysis identified uncertainties: Team boundaries are hypothetical - this appears to be a single-team monorepo project. The team structure represents logical ownership domains rather than actual separate teams.; The 'microservices' classification is architectural potential rather than actual deployment - currently all modules are part of a monolithic CLI application.

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | medium |
| Effort | small |
| Category | team |

## REC-005: Standardize development patterns

Multiple inconsistent patterns detected. Create and enforce architectural guidelines.

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Impact | medium |
| Effort | medium |
| Category | tooling |
