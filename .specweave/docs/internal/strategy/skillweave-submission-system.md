## 1. Overview

The submission system processes skill verification requests through a deterministic state machine backed by Cloudflare Queues. It combines automated scanning (Tiers 1-2), decision logic (auto-approve vs manual review), admin actions, and email notifications into a transparent pipeline.

---

## 2. Web Submission Form

The `/submit` page accepts skill verification requests via a web form.

### Form Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|-------|------|----------|------------|
| GitHub Repo URL | URL input | Yes | Must match `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` pattern |
| Skill Name | Text input | Yes | 2-64 chars, alphanumeric + hyphens |
| Email | Email input | No | Valid email format; enables status notifications |
| Category | Select | No | Predefined: security, coding, writing, devops, testing, other |

### UX Flow
1. User enters GitHub repo URL → auto-extracts owner/repo
2. If repo contains `SKILL.md` at root, preview shown inline
3. User confirms skill name (auto-suggested from repo name)
4. Optional email for notifications
5. Submit → immediate feedback: "Scanning started" with tracking link
6. Redirect to status page: `/submissions/{id}`

### Validation Rules
- Repo must be public and accessible
- Repo must contain a `SKILL.md` file
- Same repo+skill combo cannot be resubmitted while a submission is in progress
- Rate limit: 5 submissions per hour per IP

## 3. State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RECEIVED: Submission created

    RECEIVED --> VENDOR_APPROVED: Vendor org detected
    RECEIVED --> TIER1_SCANNING: Non-vendor submission

    TIER1_SCANNING --> TIER2_SCANNING: Tier 1 PASS
    TIER1_SCANNING --> TIER1_FAILED: Tier 1 FAIL

    TIER2_SCANNING --> AUTO_APPROVED: Score >= 80
    TIER2_SCANNING --> NEEDS_REVIEW: Score 60-79
    TIER2_SCANNING --> REJECTED: Score < 60

    NEEDS_REVIEW --> TIER3_REVIEW: Admin escalates
    NEEDS_REVIEW --> REJECTED: Admin rejects

    TIER3_REVIEW --> PUBLISHED: Reviewer approves
    TIER3_REVIEW --> REJECTED: Reviewer rejects

    AUTO_APPROVED --> PUBLISHED: Version assigned
    VENDOR_APPROVED --> PUBLISHED: Version assigned

    TIER1_FAILED --> [*]
    REJECTED --> [*]
    PUBLISHED --> [*]
```

### States
| State | Description | Terminal? |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| RECEIVED | Submission created | No |
| TIER1_SCANNING | Pattern scan running | No |
| TIER1_FAILED | Pattern scan failed | Yes |
| TIER2_SCANNING | LLM judge running | No |
| AUTO_APPROVED | Both tiers passed | No |
| NEEDS_REVIEW | Flagged for admin | No |
| TIER3_REVIEW | Human review in progress | No |
| PUBLISHED | Live on registry | Yes |
| REJECTED | Failed verification | Yes |
| VENDOR_APPROVED | Trusted org bypass | No |

## 4. API Specification Summary

### Public Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/submissions` | Submit a skill |
| GET | `/api/v1/submissions/:id` | Check status |
| GET | `/api/v1/skills` | Browse registry |
| GET | `/api/v1/skills/:name` | Skill detail |
| GET | `/api/v1/skills/:name/badge` | SVG badge |

### Admin Endpoints (JWT required)

| Method | Path | Description | Role |
|--------|------|-------------|------|
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Admin login | — |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` | Refresh token | — |

## 5. Decision Logic

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[Submission] --> VENDOR{Vendor org?}
    VENDOR -->|Yes| APPROVE[Auto-Approve]
    VENDOR -->|No| T1[Tier 1 Scan]
    T1 -->|FAIL| REJECT[Reject]
    T1 -->|PASS| T2[Tier 2 Scan]
    T2 -->|Score >= 80| PRIV{High-privilege?}
    T2 -->|60-79| REVIEW[Needs Review]
    T2 -->|< 60| REJECT
    PRIV -->|No| APPROVE
    PRIV -->|Yes| REVIEW
```

### Thresholds (Configurable)
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-approve minimum | 80 | Tier 2 score for auto-approval |
| Concerns minimum | 60 | Below this = reject |
| High-privilege check | enabled | Flag Bash(*), system dirs, env vars |

### Edge Cases
- Score 75-79: NEEDS_REVIEW, low urgency
- Vendor org + security report: Per-skill trust revocation
- Score 85 but has eval(): NEEDS_REVIEW (high-privilege flag)

## 6. Worker Architecture

**Cloudflare Queues** for job distribution (push-based, no polling). PostgreSQL for result storage only.

```
submission-pipeline queue
  ├── tier1-scan messages
  ├── tier2-scan messages
  └── publish messages
```

- **Delivery**: Push-based, at-least-once via Cloudflare Queues
- **Retry**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (managed by Queues)
- **Dead letter**: Failed messages after 3 retries go to `submission-dlq` queue
- **Batch processing**: Up to 10 messages per batch, 30s timeout
- **Cost**: Free tier covers 10K ops/day (~3,333 messages/day)

## 7. Email Notification Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Submitter
    participant P as Pipeline
    participant R as Resend API

    S->>P: Submit skill (with optional email)
    P->>R: submission_received email
    P->>P: Tier 1 scan
    P->>P: Tier 2 scan

    alt Auto-approved
        P->>R: auto_approved email
    else Needs review
        P->>R: needs_review email
        P->>P: Admin reviews
        alt Approved
            P->>R: auto_approved email
        else Rejected
            P->>R: rejected email
        end
    else Rejected
        P->>R: rejected email
    end
```

### Triggers
| Event | Template | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| Submission received | Welcome + tracking link | Immediate |
| Auto-approved | Badge URL + README embed code | On publish |
| Needs review | Concerns list + timeline | On flag |
| Rejected | Reason + fix suggestions + resubmit link | On rejection |
| Version published | Version diff + updated badge URL | On new version |

### Service: Resend
- 100 emails/day free tier
- React Email templates in `packages/web/src/emails/`
- Email is opt-in — no email = check status via API

---

## 8. Audit Trail

Every state transition creates an immutable `SubmissionStateEvent`:

```typescript
{
  fromState: 'TIER2_SCANNING',
  toState: 'AUTO_APPROVED',
  trigger: 'tier2-pass',
  actor: 'worker',
  metadata: { score: 92, model: '@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct' },
  createdAt: '2026-02-15T18:00:15Z'
}
```

## 9. SLA Targets

| Stage | Target | P95 |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Tier 1 scan | < 500ms | < 1s |
| Tier 2 scan | < 15s | < 30s |
| End-to-end (no review) | < 30s | < 60s |
| Human review | < 5 business days | < 10 days |
