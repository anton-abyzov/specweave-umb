# US-003: Hook-Layer Installation Support

**Feature**: [FS-195](./FEATURE.md)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US3-01**: `user-prompt-submit.sh` can detect and suggest `@playwright/cli` installation
- [x] **AC-US3-02**: Installation is non-blocking and respects `pluginAutoLoad.suggestOnly` setting
- [x] **AC-US3-03**: CLI availability is cached in session to avoid repeated checks

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0195-playwright-cli-integration](../../../../increments/0195-playwright-cli-integration/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
