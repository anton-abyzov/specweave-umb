# US-002: As a user, I want repo links to be unobtrusive and consistent with the existing design language.

**Feature**: [FS-282](./FEATURE.md)

- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Repo links show abbreviated format (owner/repo, stripping github.com prefix)
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Repo links use click event stopPropagation where the row itself is a link/button
