# US-Task Linkage Architecture

**Feature**: [FS-047](./FEATURE.md)

## Overview

Implement explicit traceability between User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Tasks to enable automatic living docs sync and AC validation. This feature addresses a critical gap in SpecWeave's traceability infrastructure where tasks in `tasks.md` have no explicit connection to their parent User Stories, causing broken living docs sync and preventing automatic AC coverage validation.
