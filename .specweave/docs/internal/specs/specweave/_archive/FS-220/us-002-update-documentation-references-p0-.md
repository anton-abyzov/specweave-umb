# US-002: Update documentation references (P0)

**Feature**: [FS-220](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** contributor
**I want** CONTRIBUTING.md to reference the correct docs commands
**So that** I know how to preview and build docs

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: CONTRIBUTING.md references `specweave docs preview` and `specweave docs build` instead of `npm run docs:*`
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: For public site development, CONTRIBUTING.md shows `cd docs-site && npm start` as the direct approach

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0220-docs-site-cleanup](../../../../../increments/0220-docs-site-cleanup/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
