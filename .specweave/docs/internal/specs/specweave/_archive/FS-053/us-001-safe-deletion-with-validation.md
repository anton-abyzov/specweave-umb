# US-001: Safe Deletion with Validation (Priority: P1)

**Feature**: [FS-053](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** framework maintainer
**I want** to delete a feature with automatic validation for orphaned references
**So that** I can safely clean up duplicate or obsolete features without breaking increments

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US1-01**: Command validates no active increments reference the feature
- [x] **AC-US1-02**: Command validates no completed increments reference the feature (warns, doesn't block)
- [x] **AC-US1-03**: Command shows detailed validation report before deletion
- [x] **AC-US1-04**: Validation report includes file paths, increment IDs, git status
- [x] **AC-US1-05**: Command requires explicit confirmation before deletion (interactive prompt)
- [x] **AC-US1-06**: Deletion is blocked if active increments found (safe mode)
- [x] **AC-US1-01**: Command validates no active increments reference the feature
- [x] **AC-US1-02**: Command validates no completed increments reference the feature (warns, doesn't block)
- [x] **AC-US1-03**: Command shows detailed validation report before deletion
- [x] **AC-US1-04**: Validation report includes file paths, increment IDs, git status
- [x] **AC-US1-05**: Command requires explicit confirmation before deletion (interactive prompt)
- [x] **AC-US1-06**: Deletion is blocked if active increments found (safe mode)
