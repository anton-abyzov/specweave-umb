# US-002: Force Deletion Mode (Priority: P1)

**Feature**: [FS-053](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** framework maintainer with orphaned increments
**I want** to force-delete a feature even if references exist
**So that** I can clean up stale features after manually updating increments

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: `--force` flag bypasses active increment validation
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Force deletion logs warning about orphaned increments
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Force deletion updates orphaned increment metadata (removes feature_id field)
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Force deletion still requires explicit confirmation
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: Force deletion report shows which increments will be orphaned
- [x] **AC-US2-01**: `--force` flag bypasses active increment validation
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Force deletion logs warning about orphaned increments
