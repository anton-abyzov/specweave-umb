# US-002: Multi-Area ADO Import

**Feature**: [FS-066](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user with ADO area paths,
**I want** to select area paths to import during init,
**So that** work items are organized by team/area in separate folders.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Init detects ADO project structure (area paths, teams)
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: User can choose organization strategy (simple/by-area/by-team)
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: "By area" shows checkbox to select which area paths
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Selected areas create `specs/ADO-{Area}/` folder structure
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: Sync profile stores area path config for future syncs

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0066-multi-project-jira-ado-init](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0066-multi-project-jira-ado-init/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
