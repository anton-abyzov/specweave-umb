# US-002: On-Demand Plugin Installation

**Feature**: [FS-171](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer,
**I want** full SpecWeave plugins to install automatically when detected,
**So that** I get full functionality without manual steps.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Skills copy from cache to `~/.claude/skills/` on detection
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Hot-reload activates skills within same session (no restart)
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Already-installed skills are not re-copied (idempotent)
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Installation completes in <2 seconds
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: User sees brief "Loading SpecWeave..." message during install
