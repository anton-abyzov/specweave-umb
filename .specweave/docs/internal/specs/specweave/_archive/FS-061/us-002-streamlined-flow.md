# US-002: Streamlined Flow

**Feature**: [FS-061](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user
**I want** minimal questions during multi-repo setup
**So that** configuration is fast and intuitive

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Flow: Platform → Owner → Pattern → Select Parent → Done
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: No redundant discovery calls (single discovery phase)
- [ ] **AC-US2-03**: Remote URL format auto-detected or asked once, not per-repo (deferred)

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0061-fix-multi-repo-init-ux](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0061-fix-multi-repo-init-ux/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
