# US-001: As a Developer, I want CLI commands to use logger abstraction

**Feature**: [FS-046](./FEATURE.md)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US1-01**: All CLI command files use logger injection pattern (20/20 complete)
- [x] **AC-US1-02**: All `console.*` calls in CLI commands now documented as user-facing exceptions (20/20 complete)
- [x] **AC-US1-03**: Logger infrastructure added to all CLI commands (N/A - tests validate user output)
- [x] **AC-US1-04**: Pre-commit hook prevents new `console.*` violations with smart detection
- [x] **AC-US1-05**: User-facing output quality unchanged (console.* preserved for UX)
