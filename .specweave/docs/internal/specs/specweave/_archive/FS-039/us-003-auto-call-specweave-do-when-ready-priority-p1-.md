# US-003: Auto-Call /specweave:do When Ready (Priority: P1)

**Feature**: [FS-039](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer with a complete plan.md and tasks.md
**I want** /specweave:next to automatically call /specweave:do
**So that** I can start implementation without manual command execution

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US3-01**: Detect plan.md and tasks.md exist with uncompleted tasks
- [ ] **AC-US3-02**: Auto-invoke /specweave:do to execute next task
- [ ] **AC-US3-03**: Resume from last incomplete task
- [ ] **AC-US3-04**: User can skip auto-execution with --dry-run flag

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0039-ultra-smart-next-command](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0039-ultra-smart-next-command/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
