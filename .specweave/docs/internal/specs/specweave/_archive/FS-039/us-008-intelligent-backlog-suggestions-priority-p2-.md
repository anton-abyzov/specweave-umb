# US-008: Intelligent Backlog Suggestions (Priority: P2)

**Feature**: [FS-039](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer who completed all active increments
**I want** /specweave:next to suggest backlog items intelligently
**So that** I don't waste time deciding what to work on next

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US8-03**: Filter by dependencies
- [ ] **AC-US8-04**: Display top 3 recommendations with rationale
