# US-004: Auto-Suggest Validation When Appropriate (Priority: P2)

**Feature**: [FS-039](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer who completed all P1 tasks
**I want** /specweave:next to suggest running /specweave:validate
**So that** I can catch issues before attempting closure

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US4-01**: Detect all P1 tasks completed but not validated
- [ ] **AC-US4-02**: Suggest /specweave:validate with clear rationale
- [ ] **AC-US4-03**: User can auto-validate with --auto-validate flag
- [ ] **AC-US4-04**: Skip validation if already run recently

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0039-ultra-smart-next-command](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0039-ultra-smart-next-command/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
