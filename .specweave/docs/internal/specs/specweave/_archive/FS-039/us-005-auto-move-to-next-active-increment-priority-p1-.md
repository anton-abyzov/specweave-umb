# US-005: Auto-Move to Next Active Increment (Priority: P1)

**Feature**: [FS-039](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer with multiple increments in progress
**I want** /specweave:next to move to the next active increment when current is done
**So that** I can continue work without manually selecting the next increment

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US5-01**: Detect current increment is completed
- [ ] **AC-US5-02**: Find next active increment (oldest by lastActivity)
- [ ] **AC-US5-03**: Validate WIP limit before switching
- [ ] **AC-US5-04**: Display next increment context

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0039-ultra-smart-next-command](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0039-ultra-smart-next-command/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
