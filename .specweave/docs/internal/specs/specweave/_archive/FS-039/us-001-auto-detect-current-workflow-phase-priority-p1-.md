# US-001: Auto-Detect Current Workflow Phase (Priority: P1)

**Feature**: [FS-039](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer working in SpecWeave
**I want** /specweave:next to automatically detect where I am in the workflow
**So that** I don't need to remember which command to run next

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: Detect if no increments exist (clean slate)
- [ ] **AC-US1-02**: Detect if spec.md exists but no plan.md/tasks.md (needs planning)
- [ ] **AC-US1-03**: Detect if plan.md/tasks.md exist with incomplete tasks (needs execution)
- [ ] **AC-US1-04**: Detect if all P1 tasks completed but not validated (needs validation)
- [ ] **AC-US1-05**: Detect if increment completed but not closed (needs closure)
- [ ] **AC-US1-06**: Detect if all increments closed (suggest new or backlog)
- [ ] **AC-US1-07**: Detect multi-project context (project-specific detection)
