# US-002: Implement Centralized Project Resolution Service

**Feature**: [FS-140](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer working with project assignments
**I want** a single, authoritative project resolution service
**So that** all code paths use consistent, correct project information

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: New `ProjectResolutionService` class created in `src/core/project/project-resolution.ts`
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Service has `resolveProjectForIncrement(incrementId): Promise<string>` method
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Resolution priority: per-US fields → config → intelligent detection
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Service caches resolved projects per increment (runtime state)
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: Service validates resolved project exists in config
- [x] **AC-US2-06**: Service handles single-project and multi-project modes correctly
- [x] **AC-US2-07**: Service logs resolution path and confidence for debugging

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0140-remove-frontmatter-project-field](../../../../increments/0140-remove-frontmatter-project-field/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
