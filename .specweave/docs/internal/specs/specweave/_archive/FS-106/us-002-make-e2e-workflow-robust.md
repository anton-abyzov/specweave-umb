# US-002: Make E2E Workflow Robust

**Feature**: [FS-106](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** maintainer
**I want** E2E workflow to handle missing secrets gracefully
**So that** scheduled runs don't fail if API key is unavailable

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US2-01**: E2E workflow skips or provides clear message when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY missing
- [ ] **AC-US2-02**: Workflow doesn't create failure noise in Actions tab

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0106-ci-health-improvements](../../../../increments/0106-ci-health-improvements/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
