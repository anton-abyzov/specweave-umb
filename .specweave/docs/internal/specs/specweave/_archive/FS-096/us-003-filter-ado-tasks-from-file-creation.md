# US-003: Filter ADO Tasks from file creation

**Feature**: [FS-096](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user importing from ADO
**I want** Tasks to become checkboxes in User Stories, not separate files
**So that** the hierarchy matches SpecWeave conventions

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US3-01**: Work item type "Task" is filtered from file creation
- [x] **AC-US3-02**: Tasks are stored as metadata for User Story checkbox generation
- [x] **AC-US3-03**: Existing task checkbox format from increment 0095 is used

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0096-ado-import-fixes](../../../../../increments/0096-ado-import-fixes/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
