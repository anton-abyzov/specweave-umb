# US-002: Fix feature title for epic-group features

**Feature**: [FS-096](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user viewing imported features
**I want** FEATURE.md to show the actual ADO item title
**So that** I can identify what the feature represents

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Epic-group features use the parent item's title
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: External link points to ADO item URL
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Work item type label is preserved (Capability/Epic)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
