# Fix Automatic GitHub Sync on Increment Creation

**Feature**: [FS-056](./FEATURE.md)

## Overview

**Problem**: Currently, when a new increment is created with user stories, GitHub issues are NOT created automatically despite existing infrastructure. Users must manually run `/specweave-github:sync` after creating an increment, breaking workflow and creating friction.

## User Stories

See user story files in this directory.
