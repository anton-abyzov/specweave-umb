# SpecWeave Implementation: External Tool Status Synchronization

**Feature**: [FS-031](./FEATURE.md)

## Overview

Enhance SpecWeave's external tool integration (GitHub, JIRA, Azure DevOps) with bidirectional status synchronization, rich content sync, and task-level traceability. This addresses critical gaps identified in user feedback (GitHub Issue #37) where external issues show only file references instead of full content, and status changes don't sync automatically.

## SpecWeave-Specific Context
