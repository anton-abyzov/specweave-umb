# US-002: Test Result Parsing (Not Just Execution)

**Feature**: [FS-150](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer in auto mode
**I want** the stop hook to verify tests actually PASSED
**So that** auto mode doesn't claim success when tests are failing

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US2-01**: Stop hook parses test output for FAIL/ERROR patterns
- [ ] **AC-US2-02**: Stop hook extracts specific failing test name and error message
- [ ] **AC-US2-03**: Stop hook blocks completion if ANY test is failing
- [ ] **AC-US2-04**: Stop hook reports accurate pass/fail counts
- [ ] **AC-US2-05**: Works for: npm test, vitest, jest, playwright, pytest, go test

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0150-auto-mode-world-class-testing](../../../../increments/0150-auto-mode-world-class-testing/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
