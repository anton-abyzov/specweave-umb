# US-002: CLI-First Defaults (Import All by Default)

**Feature**: [FS-049](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** CLI power user expecting efficient workflows
**I want** "Import all" to be the default choice with all checkboxes pre-checked
**So that** I spend seconds deselecting unwanted items instead of minutes selecting wanted items

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Upfront strategy choice before loading projects
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: "Import all" is default selection (recommended)
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Checkbox mode has all projects checked by default
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Clear instructions shown to user
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: Safety confirmation for large imports (> 100 projects)
- [x] **AC-US2-06**: Manual entry option for users wanting 1-2 projects

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0049-cli-first-init-flow](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0049-cli-first-init-flow/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
