# US-002: Organization Structure Synthesis

## Description

As a **CTO reviewing our tech landscape**, I want **repos automatically grouped into teams/services/domains** so that **I can see the big picture without manual curation**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Repos clustered by likely team ownership
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Repos clustered by microservice boundaries
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: Repos clustered by business domain
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: External specs (from Jira/ADO) inform clustering
- [x] **AC-US2-05**: Generated structure saved to `/organization/`
- [x] **AC-US2-06**: Nested folders for hierarchy (teams -> repos)
