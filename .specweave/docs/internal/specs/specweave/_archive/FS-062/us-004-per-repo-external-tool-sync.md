# US-004: Per-Repo External Tool Sync (DEFERRED)

**Feature**: [FS-062](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer with multiple repos
**I want** each repo to sync to its own GitHub issues
**So that** issues appear in the correct repository

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US4-01**: GitHub sync uses repo's own config, not parent config
- [ ] **AC-US4-02**: Issues created in `sw-qr-menu-fe` repo for FE user stories
- [ ] **AC-US4-03**: Issues created in `sw-qr-menu-be` repo for BE user stories
- [ ] **AC-US4-04**: Cross-project issues created in all relevant repos with linking

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0062-umbrella-multi-repo-support](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0062-umbrella-multi-repo-support/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
