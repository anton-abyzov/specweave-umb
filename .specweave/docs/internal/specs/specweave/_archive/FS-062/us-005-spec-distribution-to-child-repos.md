# US-005: Spec Distribution to Child Repos (DEFERRED)

**Feature**: [FS-062](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** PM
**I want** to plan a feature that spans multiple repos
**So that** each repo gets its relevant portion of the spec

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US5-01**: Planning in parent repo creates distributed specs
- [ ] **AC-US5-02**: Each child repo's `.specweave/increments/` gets only its user stories
- [ ] **AC-US5-03**: Shared dependencies tracked in spec frontmatter
- [ ] **AC-US5-04**: `/specweave:distribute-spec` command for manual distribution

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0062-umbrella-multi-repo-support](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0062-umbrella-multi-repo-support/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
