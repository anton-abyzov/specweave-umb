# US-002: Convert Architect Agent to Skill

**Feature**: [FS-155](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user asking about system design
**I want** the Architect skill to auto-activate
**So that** I get architecture guidance automatically

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US2-01**: Architect moved from `agents/architect/` to `skills/architect/SKILL.md`
- [x] **AC-US2-02**: Description optimized for activation keywords
- [x] **AC-US2-03**: ADR templates moved to progressive disclosure
- [x] **AC-US2-04**: Skill activates for "architecture", "design", "ADR" prompts
