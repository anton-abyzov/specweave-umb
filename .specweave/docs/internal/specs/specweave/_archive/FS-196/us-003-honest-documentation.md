# US-003: Honest Documentation

**Feature**: [FS-196](./FEATURE.md)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US3-01**: SKILL.md accurately describes hook capabilities (task/AC counting only, no test running)
- [x] **AC-US3-02**: SKILL.md documents that quality gates are enforced by /sw:done, not the hook
- [x] **AC-US3-03**: Default config values (maxTurns=20, maxSessionAge=7200) are visible in docs

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0196-auto-mode-v5-stop-hook](../../../../increments/0196-auto-mode-v5-stop-hook/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
