# US-001: Eliminate Duplicate Test Directories (Priority: P1 - CRITICAL)

**Feature**: [FS-042](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** SpecWeave contributor
**I want** duplicate test directories automatically removed
**So that** CI time is reduced by 47% and test maintenance is simplified

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: All 62 flat duplicate directories deleted from `tests/integration/`
- [ ] **AC-US1-02**: Only categorized structure remains (core/, features/, external-tools/, generators/)
- [ ] **AC-US1-03**: All integration tests still pass after deletion
- [ ] **AC-US1-04**: CI test execution time reduced by at least 40%
- [ ] **AC-US1-05**: Automated cleanup script provided for verification
