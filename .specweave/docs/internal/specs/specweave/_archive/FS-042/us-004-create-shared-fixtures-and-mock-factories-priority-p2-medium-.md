# US-004: Create Shared Fixtures and Mock Factories (Priority: P2 - MEDIUM)

**Feature**: [FS-042](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** SpecWeave contributor
**I want** shared test fixtures and mock factories
**So that** test data is consistent, maintainable, and DRY-compliant

- [ ] **AC-US4-04**: At least 20 tests migrated to use fixtures/factories
- [ ] **AC-US4-05**: Duplicate test data reduced by at least 50%
