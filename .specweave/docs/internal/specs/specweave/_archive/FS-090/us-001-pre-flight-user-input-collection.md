---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US1-01**: System prompts for additional doc sources (Notion export, Confluence, MD folders) with path validation

- [x] **AC-US1-03**: System prompts for known pain points (free-text description)
- [x] **AC-US1-04**: System prompts for analysis depth (quick/standard/deep) with time estimates
- [x] **AC-US1-05**: All inputs are stored in job config and passed to worker
- [x] **AC-US1-06**: In CI mode, reasonable defaults are used (no interactive prompts)
