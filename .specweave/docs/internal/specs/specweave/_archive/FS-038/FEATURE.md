# Serverless Architecture Intelligence

**GitHub Project**: https://github.com/anton-abyzov/specweave/issues/651

## Overview

Enhance SpecWeave's architect and infrastructure agents with deep serverless platform awareness, context-aware recommendations, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) patterns. This feature enables developers to make informed serverless vs traditional deployment decisions based on project type, learning goals, budget constraints, and platform capabilities.

## Source

This feature was created from increment: [`0038-serverless-architecture-intelligence`](../../../../../../increments/_archive/0038-serverless-architecture-intelligence)

## Business Value

- **Informed Decision-Making**: Developers receive context-aware guidance (pet project vs production) on serverless suitability
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatic free tier and startup credit recommendations reduce infrastructure costs
- **Learning Acceleration**: Platform-specific learning paths help developers explore new serverless technologies
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Multi-cloud IaC patterns (Terraform) enable platform portability
- **Time Savings**: Pre-built serverless patterns reduce architecture planning time from days to hours

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points**:
1. **Generic Architecture Advice**: Architect agent provides one-size-fits-all recommendations without considering project context (pet project, startup, enterprise)
2. **No Serverless Awareness**: No guidance on AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs GCP Cloud Functions vs Firebase vs Supabase
3. **Cost Blindness**: No awareness of free tiers, startup credits, or cost optimization strategies
4. **Manual IaC Creation**: Developers must write Terraform/CloudFormation from scratch (time-consuming, error-prone)
5. **Platform Lock-in Risk**: No multi-cloud migration patterns or vendor-agnostic IaC templates

**User Feedback Scenarios**:
- "I'm building a pet project to learn Azure Functions - which plan should I use?"
- "I'm a startup with AWS credits - how do I maximize runway?"
- "Should I use serverless for this production app, or is traditional better?"
- "How do I provision Supabase with Terraform?"
- "What's the migration path from Firebase to AWS Lambda?"

## Projects

This feature applies to the SpecWeave framework:
- **specweave** (core framework enhancements to architect and infrastructure agents)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **Architect Agent** (existing) - Enhanced with serverless knowledge
- **Infrastructure Agent** (existing) - Enhanced with IaC generation
- **Test-Aware Planner** (existing) - Used for generating test strategies

### External Dependencies
- **Terraform** (v1.5+) - Required for IaC provisioning
- **Cloud Provider CLIs** (optional) - AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud (for deployment validation)
- **Provider Documentation** - AWS, Azure, GCP, Firebase, Supabase docs (for accuracy)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Platform Pricing Changes
**Impact**: Recommendations become outdated, user trust erodes
**Probability**: High (providers change pricing frequently)
**Mitigation**:
- Automated checks for pricing changes (GitHub Actions workflow)
- Weekly manual review of provider announcements
- User warning: "Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD"

### Risk 2: IaC Template Breakage
**Impact**: Generated Terraform fails to deploy
**Probability**: Medium (provider API changes)
**Mitigation**:
- E2E tests for each template (deploy to test account)
- Versioned templates (backward compatibility)
- Error handling with manual fallback

### Risk 3: Recommendation Bias
**Impact**: Over-recommending serverless for unsuitable projects
**Probability**: Medium (agent may default to serverless)
**Mitigation**:
- Decision tree logic (rule-based checks)
- Explicit warnings for unsuitable cases (stateful apps, long-running processes)
- User validation: "Does this recommendation make sense?"

### Risk 4: Maintenance Burden
**Impact**: Keeping 5+ platforms up-to-date is time-consuming
**Probability**: High (platforms evolve rapidly)
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize top 3 platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for P1
- Firebase/Supabase as P2 (update quarterly)
- Community contributions (open-source templates)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Support Only AWS Lambda
**Pros**: Simpler maintenance, AWS is most popular
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, excludes Azure/GCP users
**Decision**: Rejected - Multi-cloud support is key differentiator

### Alternative 2: Use CloudFormation Instead of Terraform
**Pros**: Native AWS integration
**Cons**: AWS-only, no multi-cloud portability
**Decision**: Rejected - Terraform is industry standard for multi-cloud

### Alternative 3: AI-Only Recommendations (No Templates)
**Pros**: Simpler implementation
**Cons**: Users still write IaC manually (time-consuming)
**Decision**: Rejected - Templates provide immediate value

### Alternative 4: Partner with Cloud Providers
**Pros**: Access to latest features, potential co-marketing
**Cons**: Neutrality concerns, potential bias
**Decision**: Deferred - Consider for future (community-driven for now)
