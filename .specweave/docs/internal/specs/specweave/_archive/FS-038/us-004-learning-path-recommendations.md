# US-004: Learning Path Recommendations

**Feature**: [FS-038](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer learning a new serverless platform
**I want** curated learning resources and sample projects
**So that** I can quickly ramp up and avoid common pitfalls

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US4-01**: Agent provides platform-specific tutorials (beginner, intermediate, advanced) (P2, testable)
- [ ] **AC-US4-02**: Agent recommends sample projects (Hello World, REST API, Full-Stack App) (P2, testable)
- [ ] **AC-US4-03**: Agent shares best practices guides (performance, security, cost optimization) (P2, testable)
- [ ] **AC-US4-04**: Agent warns about common pitfalls (cold starts, memory limits, timeouts) (P2, testable)
- [ ] **AC-US4-05**: Agent provides learning vs production trade-offs (new platform vs familiar platform) (P2, testable)
- [ ] **AC-US4-06**: Learning resources are up-to-date (verified within 60 days) (P2, testable)

Agent:
📚 AWS Lambda Learning Path

🟢 Beginner (Start Here):
   1. Getting Started with AWS Lambda (30 min)
      → https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/getting-started/
      Topics: Lambda basics, Console, First function

   2. AWS Lambda Tutorial (1 hour)
      → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBq__h4OJ4
      Topics: Hands-on, Node.js examples

   Sample Project: Hello World Lambda
      → https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-hello-world
      Complexity: Beginner

🟡 Intermediate (After basics):
   • Building Serverless REST APIs (2 hours)
   • Sample: CRUD API with DynamoDB

🔴 Advanced (Production-ready):
   • Serverless Patterns Collection
   • Sample: Full e-commerce platform

💡 Best Practices:
   Performance:
      • Use provisioned concurrency for low latency
      • Optimize package size (< 50MB)
      • Reuse connections outside handler

   Security:
      • Least-privilege IAM roles
      • Secrets Manager for secrets (not env vars)

⚠️  Common Pitfalls:
   • Cold starts (200-500ms) → Mitigation: Provisioned concurrency
   • 15-min execution limit → Mitigation: Use Step Functions for long workflows
   • 10GB memory limit → Mitigation: Use Fargate for high-memory tasks

🎯 Recommended Next Steps:
   1. Complete "Getting Started" tutorial (30 min)
   2. Deploy Hello World sample to your AWS account
   3. Generate Terraform config: /infrastructure aws-lambda
```

## Business Rationale

Developers choose platforms based on learning curve and ecosystem support. Curated learning paths reduce friction and increase adoption of SpecWeave-recommended platforms.

---

## Test Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- JSON schema validation for learning paths
- Data freshness detection (> 60 days warns)

**Integration Tests**:
- Load learning path data in serverless-recommender skill
- Query by platform and skill level

**E2E Tests**:
- User asks "How do I learn Firebase?"
- Agent provides beginner-intermediate-advanced learning path

**Coverage Target**: 85%+
