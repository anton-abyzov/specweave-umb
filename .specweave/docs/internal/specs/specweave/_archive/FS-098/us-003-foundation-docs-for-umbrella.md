# US-003: Foundation Docs for Umbrella

**Feature**: [FS-098](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user viewing generated living docs

**So that** I understand the multi-repo architecture at a glance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US3-01**: Overview shows umbrella status and child repo count
- [ ] **AC-US3-02**: Tech stack shows frameworks grouped by module type
- [ ] **AC-US3-03**: Modules skeleton includes team groupings
