# US-004: SUGGESTIONS.md Improvements

**Feature**: [FS-098](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** user completing living docs builder
**I want** SUGGESTIONS.md to show meaningful recommendations
**So that** I know which modules need documentation attention

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-US4-01**: Unmatched work items listed with suggested modules
- [ ] **AC-US4-02**: Modules without work items flagged as potential tech debt
- [ ] **AC-US4-03**: Coverage percentage calculated correctly for umbrella

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0098-umbrella-workitem-matching](../../../../../increments/0098-umbrella-workitem-matching/spec.md)
