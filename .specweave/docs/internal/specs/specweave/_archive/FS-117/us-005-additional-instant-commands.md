# US-005: Additional Instant Commands

**Feature**: [FS-117](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** SpecWeave user
**I want** more commands to be instant
**So that** my workflow is consistently fast

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US5-01**: `/specweave:workflow` reads from cache (current phase, suggestions)
- [x] **AC-US5-02**: `/specweave:costs` reads from cache (token/cost tracking)
- [x] **AC-US5-03**: Cache includes enough data for workflow suggestions

---
