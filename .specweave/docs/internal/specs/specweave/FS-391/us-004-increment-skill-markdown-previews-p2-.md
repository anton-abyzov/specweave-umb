# US-004: Increment Skill Markdown Previews (P2)

**Feature**: [FS-391](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** developer using `/sw:increment`
**I want** to see folder structure trees and AC coverage tables when choosing between increment approaches
**So that** I can quickly assess the scope and structure of proposed work

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US4-01**: `/sw:increment` SKILL.md includes instructions to use `AskUserQuestion` with `markdown` previews for scope/structure decisions
- [x] **AC-US4-02**: Tree previews show proposed folder structures with proper indentation
- [x] **AC-US4-03**: Table previews show AC coverage mapping (tasks to ACs)

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0391-askuserquestion-markdown-previews](../../../../../increments/0391-askuserquestion-markdown-previews/spec.md)

**Tasks**: See increment tasks.md for implementation details.
