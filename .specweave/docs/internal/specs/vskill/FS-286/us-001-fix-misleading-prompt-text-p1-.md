# US-001: Fix Misleading Prompt Text (P1)

**Feature**: [FS-286](./FEATURE.md)

**As a** CLI user installing skills from a multi-skill repo
**I want** clear, accurate prompt instructions
**So that** I understand what each input does without guessing

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US1-01**: Checkbox list prompt shows "Toggle: 1-N, ranges (1-3), comma-separated (1,3,5). a=all. Enter=done" instead of "space to toggle"
- [x] **AC-US1-02**: Scope prompt label reads "Scope" instead of "Installation scope:" (colon removed, more concise)
- [x] **AC-US1-03**: Method prompt label reads "Method" instead of "Installation method:" (colon removed, more concise)
