# US-003: Multi-Runner Examples in vskill CLI README

**Feature**: [FS-277](./FEATURE.md)

developer discovering vskill via its GitHub README
**I want** to see that I can use bunx, pnpx, or yarn dlx as alternatives to npx
**So that** I can use vskill with my preferred toolchain immediately

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-US3-01**: The vskill README.md top code block shows npx, bunx, pnpx, and yarn dlx alternatives for the main commands
- [x] **AC-US3-02**: The Commands section examples include alternative runners

---

## Implementation

**Increment**: [0277-multi-package-manager-docs](../../../../../increments/0277-multi-package-manager-docs/spec.md)
