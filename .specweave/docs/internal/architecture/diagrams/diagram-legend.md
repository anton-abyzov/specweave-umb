## Node Types & Colors

### 🔵 Agents (Light Blue)
**Color**: `#e1f5ff` (fill), `#0288d1` (border)

Represents AI agents that perform complex, multi-step tasks in separate context windows.

**Examples**:
- `PM Agent` - Product Manager (requirements gathering)
- `Architect Agent` - System design and ADRs
- `QA Agent` - Test strategy and coverage
- `Security Agent` - Threat modeling
- `DevOps Agent` - Infrastructure design

**Invoked via**: `Task` tool with `subagent_type` parameter

---

### 🟠 Skills (Light Orange)
**Color**: `#fff3e0` (fill), `#f57c00` (border)

Represents skills that activate automatically based on context, sharing main conversation window.

**Examples**:
- `skill-router` - Routes requests to appropriate skills
- `context-loader` - Loads context via manifest (Pass 1)
- `context-optimizer` - Optimizes context via intent analysis (Pass 2)
- `increment-validator` - Rule-based validation
- `increment-quality-judge` - LLM-as-Judge quality scoring
- `docs-updater` - Documentation updates

**Activates**: Automatically when keywords/conditions match

---

### 💎 Decision Diamonds (Purple)
**Color**: `#f3e5f5` (fill), `#7b1fa2` (border)

Represents decision points where workflow branches based on conditions.

**Examples**:
- `".specweave/ exists?"` - Check if SpecWeave initialized
- `"Score ≥ 0.80?"` - Quality threshold check
- `"Infrastructure needed?"` - Conditional DevOps agent
- `"Tests Pass?"` - Test validation gate
- `"More features to build?"` - Workflow continuation

**Format**: Always phrased as a question with Yes/No paths

---

### ✅ Success Nodes (Green)
**Color**: `#e8f5e9` (fill), `#388e3c` (border)

Represents successful completion of a phase or validation gate.

**Examples**:
- `✅ Project Ready` - Initialization complete
- `✅ Increment Planned` - Planning phase done
- `✅ Validation Passed` - Validation successful
- `✅ Implementation Done` - Code complete
- `✅ Docs Updated` - Documentation updated
- `✅ Deployed` - Deployment successful

**Indicates**: Milestone reached, ready to proceed

---

### ⚠️ Warning Nodes (Yellow)
**Color**: `#fff9c4` (fill), `#f57f17` (border)

Represents warnings or issues that require user attention but don't block workflow.

**Examples**:
- `⚠️ Warn User: Review Report` - Validation issues found
- `⚠️ Warn: Missing Coverage` - Test coverage incomplete

**Indicates**: User should review but workflow can continue

---

### 🔄 Feedback Loop Nodes (Blue Dashed)
**Color**: `#e3f2fd` (fill), `#1976d2` (border), `stroke-dasharray: 5 5`

Represents refinement/iteration steps in auto-refinement feedback loops.

**Examples**:
- `🔄 Refine with feedback` - Agent refines output based on validation
- `🔄 Ready for first increment` - Loop back to increment creation

**Indicates**: Iterative improvement, up to max 3 attempts

**Styling**: Dashed border distinguishes from regular nodes

---

## Symbols & Annotations

### 📁 File Location

## File Organization Patterns

### Increment-Scoped Files
All in `.specweave/increments/_archive/0001-name/`:
- `spec.md` - Requirements
- `plan.md` - Technical design
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist
- `tests.md` - Test strategy
- `security.md` - Threat model
- `reports/` - Validation/quality reports
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
- `logs/` - Execution logs
- `infra/` - Infrastructure code

**Benefit**: Complete traceability, easy cleanup, clear context

---

### Shared Documentation
In `.specweave/docs/internal/`:
- `strategy/` - Business specs (WHAT, WHY)
- `architecture/` - Technical design (HOW)
  - `adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
  - `diagrams/` - System diagrams
- `delivery/` - Roadmap, CI/CD, guides
- `operations/` - Runbooks, SLOs
- `governance/` - Security, compliance

**Benefit**: Cross-increment knowledge sharing

---

### Test Repository
In `.specweave/tests/` (centralized) or `tests/` (project root):
- `unit/` - Unit tests
- `integration/` - Integration tests
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests (Playwright)

**Benefit**: Organized by test type, easy to run

---

## Reading the Diagram

### Top-to-Bottom Flow
Workflow generally flows from top to bottom, left to right.

**Start**: `User Request`
**End**: `Workflow Complete` or `Project Complete`

---

### Subgraph Boundaries
Dashed rectangles group related steps.

**Purpose**: Visual organization, shows phases

---

### Decision Points
Always diamond-shaped, always phrased as questions.

**Format**: `Condition?`
**Paths**: Yes (down/right), No (right/down)

---

### Feedback Loops
Look for dashed-border nodes connecting back to earlier steps.

**Identifies**: Iteration, refinement, retry logic

---

## Example: Reading Auto-Refinement Loop

```
PM Agent (Round 1) [Blue Agent]
  ↓
Validate Quality [Orange Skill]
  ↓
Score ≥ 0.80? [Purple Diamond]
  ↓ No (Attempt 1/3)
🔄 Refine with feedback [Blue Dashed Loop Node]
  ↓
PM Agent (Round 2) [Blue Agent]
  ↓
Validate Quality [Orange Skill]
  ↓
Score ≥ 0.80? [Purple Diamond]
  ↓ Yes
✅ PM Done [Green Success]
  ↓
Architect Agent [Blue Agent]
```

**Key Points**:
1. Agent generates output (blue)
2. Skill validates quality (orange)
3. Decision checks score (purple)
4. If fails, refine (dashed blue loop)
5. If passes, proceed (green success)
6. Next agent starts (blue)
