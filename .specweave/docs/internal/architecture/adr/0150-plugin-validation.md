# ADR-0150: Proactive Plugin Validation System

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-11-09
**Deciders**: Anton Abyzov
**Context**: Increment 0014

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Users moving between development environments (local machine → VM → Cloud IDE → CI/CD pipeline) experienced consistent friction when SpecWeave marketplace or plugins weren't installed. This resulted in:

1. **Cryptic error messages**: "command not found" errors without clear guidance
2. **Manual intervention required**: 10-15 minutes per environment to install marketplace + plugins
3. **Workflow interruptions**: Users had to stop mid-task to debug installation issues
4. **Onboarding friction**: New team members struggled with setup, reducing adoption

**Example scenario**:
```
User on new VM:
1. Clone project
2. Run /specweave:increment "Add authentication"
3. ❌ Error: "specweave: command not found"
4. Debug for 10-15 minutes
5. Manually edit ~/.claude/settings.json
6. Manually run /plugin install specweave
7. Restart Claude Code
8. Re-run command
9. ✅ Finally works (but 15 minutes wasted)
```

This violated SpecWeave's core principle: **"Just works" in ANY environment with ZERO manual setup.**

---

## Decision Drivers

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Zero manual plugin installation
- ✅ \&lt;5 seconds validation overhead per command
- ✅ Works across all environments (local, VM, Cloud IDE, CI/CD)
- ✅ Context-aware (suggest relevant plugins based on work)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (offline mode, CLI unavailable)
- ✅ Non-intrusive (caching to minimize overhead)

**Constraints**:
- Must work with Claude Code's native plugin system (no custom loaders)
- Must not break existing workflows (backward compatible)
- Must remain below v1.0.0 (not a breaking change)
- Must have \&lt;1% false positive rate for plugin suggestions

---

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Manual Validation (Status Quo)

**Approach**: User manually installs marketplace and plugins

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple (no code needed)
- ✅ User has full control

**Cons**:
- ❌ 10-15 minutes per environment
- ❌ Error-prone (users forget steps)
- ❌ No guidance on which plugins are needed
- ❌ Violates "just works" principle

**Decision**: Rejected - Poor UX, doesn't scale

### Option 2: Lazy Loading (Install on First Error)

**Approach**: Detect errors like "command not found" and install plugins reactively

**Pros**:
- ✅ Only installs when needed
- ✅ No upfront cost

**Cons**:
- ❌ Workflow already interrupted (user hit error)
- ❌ Error detection is fragile (many error types)
- ❌ No context-aware suggestions
- ❌ Requires parsing stderr/stdout

**Decision**: Rejected - Reactive, not proactive; fragile

### Option 3: Proactive Validation (STEP 0) ✅ **CHOSEN**

**Approach**: Validate plugins BEFORE every command executes (STEP 0), auto-install if missing

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero manual intervention
- ✅ Prevents errors before they occur (proactive)
- ✅ Context-aware plugin suggestions (keyword mapping)
- ✅ \&lt;5s overhead with caching (\&lt;2s cached)
- ✅ Clear guidance on success/failure
- ✅ Works across all environments

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Slight overhead per command (\&lt;5s uncached, \&lt;2s cached)
- ⚠️ Requires Claude CLI to be available (falls back to manual instructions)
- ⚠️ Adds complexity (673 lines of code)

**Decision**: Accepted - Best UX, aligns with "just works" principle

### Option 4: Pre-Flight Script (One-Time Setup)

**Approach**: Run validation script once during project setup

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero overhead after initial setup
- ✅ Simple to implement

**Cons**:
- ❌ Doesn't handle environment migrations (new VM)
- ❌ Users forget to run setup script
- ❌ No context-aware suggestions
- ❌ Validation can become stale (plugins uninstalled)

**Decision**: Rejected - Doesn't solve migration problem

---

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Option 3 - Proactive Validation (STEP 0)

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Core Validation Engine (`src/utils/plugin-validator.ts`)

**Validation Flow**:
```
User runs: /specweave:increment "Add GitHub sync"
   ↓
[STEP 0: Plugin Validation]
   ├─ Phase 1: Check marketplace (.claude/settings.json)
   │   ├─ Missing? → Install automatically
   │   └─ Present? → Validate structure
   ├─ Phase 2: Check core plugin (specweave)
   │   ├─ Missing? → Install automatically
   │   └─ Present? → Record version
   ├─ Phase 3: Context detection (optional)
   │   ├─ Scan description for keywords ("GitHub sync")
   │   ├─ Map to plugins (specweave-github)
   │   ├─ Missing? → Suggest to user
   │   └─ Present? → Record for later
   └─ Phase 4: Caching (5-minute TTL)
       ├─ Cache valid? → Return cached result (\&lt;2s)
       └─ Cache stale? → Re-validate (\&lt;5s)
   ↓ (Only proceeds if validation passes)
[STEP 1: PM Agent Planning]
```

#### 2. Context-Aware Plugin Detection

**Keyword Mapping** (15+ plugins):
```typescript
const PLUGIN_KEYWORDS = {
  'specweave-github': ['github', 'git', 'issues', 'pull request', 'pr', 'repository'],
  'specweave-jira': ['jira', 'epic', 'story', 'sprint', 'backlog'],
  'specweave-payments': ['stripe', 'billing', 'payment', 'subscription', 'invoice'],
  'specweave-frontend': ['react', 'nextjs', 'vue', 'angular', 'frontend', 'ui'],
  'specweave-kubernetes': ['kubernetes', 'k8s', 'helm', 'pod', 'deployment'],
  // ... 10 more plugins
};
```

**Scoring Algorithm**:
- Scan description for keywords (case-insensitive)
- Count matches per plugin
- Threshold: 2+ matches = high confidence (suggest plugin)
- Sort by match count (highest first)

**Example**:
```
Description: "Add GitHub sync with React UI and Stripe payments"
Matches:
  - specweave-github: 2 matches ("github", "sync") → SUGGEST ✅
  - specweave-frontend: 2 matches ("react", "ui") → SUGGEST ✅
  - specweave-payments: 2 matches ("stripe", "payments") → SUGGEST ✅
```

**False Positive Prevention**:
- Single keyword match = NO suggestion (too generic)
- Example: "git hooks" has 1 match ("git") → NO suggestion for specweave-github
- Prevents over-suggesting plugins

#### 3. Caching Strategy

**Cache Structure**:
```typescript
interface ValidationCache {
  timestamp: number;
  result: ValidationResult;
}
```

**Cache File**: `~/.specweave/validation-cache.json`
**TTL**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
**Invalidation**: Manual plugin changes, cache age > TTL

**Performance Impact**:
- Cached validation: \&lt;2 seconds (95% of calls)
- Uncached validation: \&lt;5 seconds (5% of calls)
- Average overhead: \&lt;2.15 seconds per command

**Why 5 minutes?**
- ✅ Balances freshness vs performance
- ✅ Handles rapid command sequences (e.g., increment → do → next)
- ✅ Invalidates after plugin installs (user has time to test)
- ✅ Not too short (would negate caching benefits)
- ✅ Not too long (would miss plugin changes)

#### 4. Graceful Degradation

**Offline Mode**:
```
1. Detect missing plugins
2. Cannot install (no network)
3. Show manual instructions:
   - Edit ~/.claude/settings.json (copy-paste config)
   - Run /plugin install specweave
   - Restart Claude Code
4. User completes manually (still better than cryptic errors)
```

**Claude CLI Unavailable**:
```
1. Detect missing plugins
2. Cannot install (CLI not found)
3. Show manual instructions (same as offline mode)
4. Log warning for debugging
```

**Permission Errors**:
```
1. Detect missing marketplace
2. Try to write ~/.claude/settings.json
3. Permission denied (EACCES)
4. Show error with clear guidance:
   - Check file permissions (chmod 644)
   - Check directory permissions (chmod 755)
   - Run as correct user (not root)
```

#### 5. Command Integration (STEP 0)

**Priority Commands** (Phase 1):
- `/specweave:increment` - Validates before PM agent runs
- `/specweave:do` - Validates before task execution
- `/specweave:next` - Validates before workflow transition

**Remaining Commands** (Phase 2 - Future):
- 19 additional commands (done, progress, validate, sync-docs, etc.)
- Bulk update with script
- Same STEP 0 template

**STEP 0 Template**:
```markdown
### Step 0: Plugin Validation (MANDATORY - ALWAYS FIRST! v0.9.4+)

🚨 **CRITICAL**: Before ANY planning or execution, validate SpecWeave plugin installation.

Use the Bash tool to run:
```bash
npx specweave validate-plugins --auto-install --context="$(cat <<'EOF'
$USER_INCREMENT_DESCRIPTION
EOF
)"
```

**If validation passes**: Proceed to Step 1
**If validation fails**: Show errors and STOP

DO NOT PROCEED until plugin validation passes!
```

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **User Experience**
- Zero manual plugin installation (10-15 minutes → \&lt;5 seconds)
- Seamless environment migration (local → VM → Cloud IDE)
- Clear error messages (no more "command not found")
- Context-aware suggestions (relevant plugins for the work)

✅ **Developer Velocity**
- No onboarding friction (new team members productive immediately)
- No workflow interruptions (validation catches issues upfront)
- No environment-specific bugs (consistent setup everywhere)

✅ **Operational**
- Works in CI/CD pipelines (automated validation)
- Graceful degradation (offline mode, CLI unavailable)
- Monitoring ready (can log validation failures)

✅ **Technical**
- Maintainable (670+ lines, well-documented)
- Testable (30+ unit tests, 95% coverage target)
- Extensible (easy to add new plugins to keyword map)

### Negative

⚠️ **Performance Overhead**
- \&lt;5 seconds per command (uncached)
- \&lt;2 seconds per command (cached)
- Acceptable for workflow commands (not tight loops)

⚠️ **Complexity**
- 673 lines of TypeScript (validation engine)
- 250 lines of CLI command
- 400+ lines of skill documentation
- Requires Claude CLI to be available (falls back gracefully)

⚠️ **Dependency on Claude Code**
- Assumes Claude CLI commands work (`/plugin install`)
- Assumes marketplace API is stable
- Assumes plugin naming convention (`specweave-*`)

⚠️ **False Positives (Minimal)**
- Keyword matching can suggest wrong plugins (\&lt;1% rate)
- Example: "Azure deployment" might suggest specweave-ado (Azure DevOps) instead of specweave-kubernetes
- Mitigation: High threshold (2+ matches), user can skip suggestions

### Neutral

🔶 **Versioning**
- Remains below v1.0.0 (v0.9.4)
- Not a breaking change (backward compatible)
- Optional feature (can be disabled in config)

## Alternatives Considered (Detailed)

### Alternative A: Bundle Plugins with SpecWeave

**Approach**: Include all plugins in npm package, auto-install during `specweave init`

**Rejected because**:
- ❌ Bloats npm package (~2MB → ~10MB)
- ❌ Users get plugins they don't need
- ❌ Doesn't solve migration problem (plugins not available in new environments)
- ❌ Violates Claude Code plugin architecture (plugins should be separate)

### Alternative B: Plugin Marketplace Auto-Discovery

**Approach**: Claude Code automatically discovers plugins from GitHub marketplace

**Rejected because**:
- ❌ Requires changes to Claude Code itself (out of scope)
- ❌ Doesn't provide context-aware suggestions
- ❌ Still requires manual installation

### Alternative C: Docker/Container Pre-Installation

**Approach**: Provide Docker images with plugins pre-installed

**Rejected because**:
- ❌ Doesn't solve local development (users don't want Docker overhead)
- ❌ Doesn't solve Cloud IDE (e.g., claude.ai/code)
- ❌ Adds deployment complexity
