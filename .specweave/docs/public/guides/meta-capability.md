# The Meta-Capability: Agents Build Agents, Skills Build Skills

**The most powerful feature you didn't know you needed**

---

## What Is Meta-Capability?

**SpecWeave isn't just a framework** - it's a **self-extending system** where:

- ✅ **Agents build agents** - Core agents create custom domain experts
- ✅ **Skills build skills** - Core skills generate specialized capabilities
- ✅ **SpecWeave builds SpecWeave** - The framework uses itself to add new features
- ✅ **You control everything** - No autonomous changes, always approved

**In other words**: The factory builds factories, and you're the architect.

---

## Why This Matters

### Traditional Frameworks

```
Framework provides tools
   ↓
You use tools to build app
   ↓
Framework stays static
   ↓
You're limited to what framework provides
```

❌ **Problem**: Framework can't adapt to YOUR domain, YOUR company, YOUR needs.

### SpecWeave's Meta-Capability

```
Framework provides core agents/skills
   ↓
You use them to build app
   ↓
You create custom agents/skills for YOUR domain
   ↓
Custom agents create MORE tools
   ↓
Framework evolves with YOUR needs
```

✅ **Solution**: Infinite extensibility tailored to your exact requirements.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. Agents Build Agents

**Scenario**: You're building a payment processing system and need Stripe expertise.

**Traditional approach**:
- Read Stripe docs
- Write boilerplate code
- Handle webhooks manually
- Debug signature verification
- Repeat for EVERY project

**SpecWeave approach**:
```
You: "Create a Stripe integration expert agent"
   ↓
SpecWeave architect agent: Designs the new agent
   ↓
Result: Custom stripe-integration agent created
   ↓
New agent knows: Stripe API, webhooks, PCI compliance, error handling
   ↓
Use it: "Implement subscription billing"
   ↓
Stripe agent: Implements production-ready code instantly
```

**One-time effort, infinite reuse** - and you can share with your team!

---

### 2. Skills Build Skills

**Scenario**: Your company has strict API conventions that every service must follow.

**Traditional approach**:
- Write style guide document
- Code reviews catch violations
- Developers forget rules
- Inconsistent APIs across services

**SpecWeave approach**:
```
You: "Create a skill to validate our company's API standards"
   ↓
SpecWeave creates: company-api-validator skill
   ↓
Skill activates automatically when you work on APIs
   ↓
Validates: RESTful naming, error format, versioning
   ↓
Catches violations BEFORE code review
```

**Codify standards once, enforce automatically forever.**

---

### 3. SpecWeave Builds SpecWeave

**Scenario**: The framework needs diagram generation capabilities.

**How it's built**:
```
Increment: 003-diagram-agents
   ↓
pm agent: Writes requirements (WHAT & WHY)
   ↓
architect agent: Designs architecture (HOW)
   ↓
docs-writer agent: Creates documentation
   ↓
Result: diagrams-architect agent added to framework
   ↓
SpecWeave now has diagram capabilities (built by SpecWeave!)
```

**The framework uses itself to improve itself** - continuous evolution.

### Example 3: Fintech with Compliance Requirements

**Phase 1**: Core banking features
```
pm agent → Transaction requirements
architect agent → Ledger design
dotnet-backend agent → Banking API
```

**Phase 2**: Create financial compliance agent
```
You: "Create financial compliance agent for SOX/GAAP"
   ↓
SpecWeave creates: fintech-compliance agent
   ↓
Agent knows:
- SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley) requirements
- GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)
- Audit trail requirements
- Financial reporting standards
```

**Phase 3**: Agent builds audit tools
```
fintech-compliance agent → Creates: audit-log-validator skill
   ↓
audit-log-validator skill:
- Validates all transactions are logged
- Ensures immutability
- Checks retention policies
```

**Result**: Fintech platform with SOX/GAAP compliance built-in!

---

## How to Use Meta-Capability

### Step 1: Identify Repetitive Patterns

**Look for**:
- Same type of work repeated across features
- Domain knowledge scattered in docs/wikis
- Manual validation that should be automated
- Company standards enforced through code review

**Ask**: "Could an agent/skill handle this automatically?"

---

### Step 2: Create Custom Agent/Skill

**For complex domain expertise** → Create agent:
```
You: "Create an agent that knows our company's coding standards"
   ↓
SpecWeave architect agent: Designs agent structure
   ↓
You: Review and approve agent definition
   ↓
Result: company-standards agent created
```

**For focused automation** → Create skill:
```
You: "Create a skill to generate SQL migrations from schema changes"
   ↓
SpecWeave architect agent: Designs skill
   ↓
You: Review and approve skill logic
   ↓
Result: migration-generator skill created
```

---

### Step 3: Use and Refine

**Use the custom agent/skill**:
```
First feature: Agent makes some mistakes
   ↓
You: Update agent definition with corrections
   ↓
Second feature: Agent performs better
   ↓
You: Further refinements based on experience
   ↓
Nth feature: Agent is production-quality
```

**Continuous improvement** - each use makes it better.

---

### Step 4: Share with Team

**Version control custom components**:
```bash
git add .claude/agents/company-standards/
git commit -m "Add company standards agent"
git push
```

**Result**: Entire team now has access to company expertise!

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Does this require coding knowledge?

**A**: No! You describe WHAT you want, SpecWeave agents BUILD it.

**Example**:
```
You: "Create an agent that validates GDPR compliance"
   ↓
architect agent: Creates agent structure
   ↓
You: Review (plain English) and approve
   ↓
No coding required!
```

---

### Q: How is this different from AI code generation?

**A**: AI code generation is one-time. Meta-capability is **continuous improvement**.

**Traditional AI coding**:
```
Ask AI → Generate code → Use once → Ask again next time
```

**SpecWeave meta-capability**:
```
Ask SpecWeave → Create agent → Use forever → Agent improves over time
```

**Reusable, refinable, shareable.**

---

### Q: Can I sell custom agents/skills?

**A**: Yes! You own them.

**Business models**:
- ✅ Sell domain-specific agents (e.g., `stripe-integration` for SaaS founders)
- ✅ Offer consulting to create custom agents for clients
- ✅ Build agent libraries for specific industries (healthcare, finance, gaming)

**Your expertise, your IP, your revenue.**

---

### Q: What if I want to keep custom agents private?

**A**: They're in your repo - you control visibility.

- ✅ Keep in private repo → Only your team has access
- ✅ Keep in `.claude/agents/` → Not published to framework
- ✅ Use `.gitignore` → Don't even commit to git

**Full control over distribution.**

---

### Q: How do I contribute custom agents back to SpecWeave?

**A**: Submit a PR to the framework!

**Steps**:
1. Create custom agent in your project
2. Test thoroughly in production
3. Move to SpecWeave's `src/agents/`
4. Submit PR with test cases
5. If accepted → Added to framework for everyone

**Community-driven growth.**

---
