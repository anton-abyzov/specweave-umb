## FULL SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: Three project types appearing - "Legacy Codebase 💀", "Startup MVP 🚀", "Enterprise Platform 🏢"]**

> "I've worked on legacy codebases where nobody knows how anything works. I've built startup MVPs at 2am with zero documentation. I've navigated enterprise platforms with 50 microservices and JIRA boards from hell.

> Every time, I thought: there HAS to be a framework that works on ALL of these.

> There wasn't. So I built one."

**[VISUAL: SpecWeave logo appearing]**

> "SpecWeave."

**[VISUAL: Quick montage - dropping into different project types]**

> "Drop it into a 10-year-old legacy codebase — it GENERATES documentation automatically in the background. Use it on your weekend startup — specs write themselves. Scale it to enterprise with 50 teams — JIRA, GitHub, Azure DevOps all sync BIDIRECTIONALLY.

> ONE framework. ANY project. ANY scale."

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side - spec.md updating, JIRA syncing, GitHub issue updating]**

> "Living documentation that never goes stale. BIDIRECTIONAL sync — changes flow BOTH ways. Background jobs that clone repos, import work items, and build docs while you work. And here's the crazy part — it works with ANY AI. Claude, GPT, Gemini, Copilot. Your team uses whatever they want.

> Need translations? One command. Russian, Spanish, German — done.

> Fortune 500 companies pay MILLIONS for systems like this.

> This? Free. Open source. And I'm going to show you EVERYTHING."

**[VISUAL: Title card - "Finally: A Framework That Works on Legacy, Startup, AND Enterprise"]**

> "Finally. A framework that actually works everywhere.

> Installation. 6 real demos. Legacy brownfield. Fresh greenfield. JIRA. GitHub. Azure DevOps.

> If this helps you — star the GitHub repo. That's how other devs find this.

> Let's go."

---

### THE PROBLEM (1:30 - 6:30)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - chaotic docs vs clean structure]**

> "Before we dive in, let me tell you why I built this.

> Every dev team I've worked with has the same problem: specs live in one place, tasks in another, code somewhere else. Nothing stays in sync. Sound familiar?"

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing disconnected tools]**

#### The Documentation Graveyard

> "You write a beautiful spec in Confluence. Two weeks later, it's wrong. The code evolved. Nobody updated the docs. Now your spec is a lie.

> JIRA says one thing. The README says another. The actual code? Who knows."

#### BMAD-Method Problems

**[VISUAL: BMAD logo/reference]**

> "Some of you tried BMAD — the AI prompt framework. Good idea. Heavy execution.

> BMAD gives you personas, mega-prompts, multi-stage workflows. But here's the problem:

> - Too much ceremony upfront
> - Not designed for real tool integration
> - No sync with JIRA, GitHub, or ADO
> - Manual everything

> It's a prompt library, not a workflow."

#### SpecKit Limitations

**[VISUAL: SpecKit reference]**

> "SpecKit tried to solve specs for AI. Better structure. But:

> - No bidirectional sync
> - No external tool integration
> - Manual status tracking
> - Closed ecosystem

> You're still copying checkboxes by hand."

#### What We Actually Need

**[VISUAL: Checklist appearing one by one]**

> "What I wanted:
> - Specs that STAY in sync with reality
> - Tasks that track themselves
> - One command to sync everything to JIRA, GitHub, or ADO
> - AI-native — Claude reads and writes specs
> - Free. Open source. No vendor lock-in.

> That's SpecWeave."

---

### WHAT IS SPECWEAVE? (6:00 - 10:00)

**[VISUAL: SpecWeave logo + quick demo montage]**

> "SpecWeave is spec-driven development for the AI age. Let me show you what you get."

#### Quick Wins in 60 Seconds

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing commands]**

```bash
# Plan work
/specweave:increment "Add user authentication"

# Execute tasks
/specweave:do

# Check progress
/specweave:progress

# Sync to GitHub/JIRA/ADO
/specweave:sync-progress

# Close when done
/specweave:done 0042
```

> "Five commands. That's your daily workflow."

#### The Magic: Living Documentation

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side - spec.md and GitHub issue updating together]**

> "When you complete a task in tasks.md, SpecWeave:
> - Updates your spec.md acceptance criteria
> - Syncs to your GitHub issue
> - Updates your JIRA epic
> - Pushes to Azure DevOps work item
> - All automatically. All bidirectional."

#### What You Get

**[VISUAL: Feature cards appearing]**

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| Increments | Atomic units of work with specs, plans, tasks |
| Living Docs | Specs that update when code changes |
| **Living Docs Builder (NEW!)** | Auto-generates docs for brownfield projects |
| External Sync | **Bidirectional** with GitHub, JIRA, ADO |
| **Pull Sync (NEW!)** | External changes flow back to SpecWeave |
| **Background Jobs (NEW!)** | Clone, import, build docs — all in background |
| AI-Native | Claude reads specs, writes code, updates tasks |
| Multi-Repo | Enterprise monorepo and multi-repo support |
| **ADO Intelligence (NEW!)** | Auto-detect process templates (SAFe, Agile, Scrum) |
| Free & Open | MIT license, no vendor lock-in |

> "All of this — free. Open source. On my GitHub right now. And these new features? Game changers. Let me teach you the foundation."

#### Documentation Architecture: Internal vs Public

**[VISUAL: Folder structure diagram]**

> "One thing that makes SpecWeave different — it separates your documentation into TWO categories."

```
.specweave/docs/
├── internal/           ← Team-only: ADRs, architecture, secrets docs
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── adr/        ← Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── governance/     ← Coding standards, team processes
│   └── emergency/      ← Runbooks, incident procedures
│
└── public/             ← User-facing: API docs, guides, tutorials
    ├── academy/        ← Learning materials
    ├── api/            ← API reference
    └── guides/         ← How-to guides
```

> "Why does this matter?

> **Internal docs** — Architecture decisions, coding standards, emergency runbooks. Stuff your TEAM needs but users don't. This stays in your repo, version-controlled with your code.

> **Public docs** — User guides, API reference, tutorials. This is what you publish to your docs site.

> The magic? Both live in the same repo. Both update with your code. But they serve DIFFERENT audiences."

#### One Command to Preview Everything

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing docs preview]**

> "Want to see your docs before publishing? One command."

```bash
# From your project root
cd docs-site && npm run start

# Opens at localhost:3016
# Hot reload - edit markdown, see changes instantly
```

> "That's it. Docusaurus spins up, hot reloads everything. Edit your markdown, see it live. No build step needed for development."

#### Hosting Options

**[VISUAL: Hosting providers logos]**

> "When you're ready to publish:"

```bash
# Build static site
npm run build

# Output in docs-site/build/
# Deploy ANYWHERE that hosts static files
```

> "Options:

> **GitHub Pages** — Free. Push to `gh-pages` branch, done. Perfect for open source.

> **Vercel/Netlify** — Free tier. Connect repo, auto-deploys on push. Zero config.

> **Self-hosted** — It's just HTML/CSS/JS. Nginx, Apache, S3, whatever.

> The point? Your docs are YOURS. Not locked in Notion. Not trapped in Confluence. Version-controlled markdown that deploys anywhere."

### ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING 101 (10:00 - 16:00)

**[VISUAL: Whiteboard-style diagrams appearing]**

> "Before we install, you need to understand HOW enterprise teams build software. This is the foundation everything else rests on."

#### The Hierarchy of Work

**[VISUAL: Pyramid diagram building up]**

```

                    └─────────────┘
```

> "Every mature company follows this pattern. JIRA does it. Azure DevOps does it. GitHub Projects tries to do it. SpecWeave makes it automatic."

#### What's a Feature?

**[VISUAL: Feature card example]**

> "A Feature — or Epic in JIRA — is a BIG piece of functionality. Something you'd put on a roadmap."

```markdown
# Feature: FS-001 User Authentication

Complete authentication system with login, registration,
password reset, and social OAuth.

Contains:
- US-001: User Registration
- US-002: User Login
- US-003: Password Reset
- US-004: OAuth Integration
```

> "One feature = multiple user stories. Features take weeks. User stories take days."

#### What's a User Story?

**[VISUAL: User story format]**

> "A User Story answers: WHO wants WHAT and WHY?"

```markdown
### US-001: User Registration

**As a** new visitor
**I want to** create an account with email and password
**So that** I can access personalized features

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-US1-01: Registration form validates email format
- [ ] AC-US1-02: Password requires 8+ characters
- [ ] AC-US1-03: Duplicate emails show clear error
- [ ] AC-US1-04: Success redirects to dashboard
```

> "Notice the format: As a WHO, I want WHAT, so that WHY. This forces clarity. No vague requirements."

#### Acceptance Criteria — The Contract

**[VISUAL: Checkboxes checking themselves]**

> "Acceptance Criteria are your contract. When all boxes are checked, the story is DONE. Not 'mostly done.' Not 'almost there.' DONE."

```markdown
- [x] AC-US1-01: Registration form validates email format
- [x] AC-US1-02: Password requires 8+ characters
- [ ] AC-US1-03: Duplicate emails show clear error  ← NOT DONE
- [x] AC-US1-04: Success redirects to dashboard
```

> "One unchecked box = story not complete. That's the discipline."

#### Tasks — The Actual Work

**[VISUAL: Task list]**

> "Tasks are what developers actually DO. Each task satisfies one or more acceptance criteria."

```markdown
### T-001: Create registration API endpoint
**Satisfies**: AC-US1-01, AC-US1-02
**Status**: [x] completed

### T-002: Add duplicate email check
**Satisfies**: AC-US1-03
**Status**: [ ] pending
```

> "See the link? Task → Acceptance Criteria → User Story → Feature. Everything traces back. Nothing gets lost."

#### SpecWeave's Increment = Atomic Delivery

**[VISUAL: Increment folder structure]**

> "SpecWeave wraps all this into an INCREMENT — an atomic unit of shippable work."

```
.specweave/increments/0001-user-auth/
├── spec.md      ← User stories + acceptance criteria
├── plan.md      ← Technical approach
├── tasks.md     ← Actual tasks with AC links
└── metadata.json ← Status, timestamps, external IDs
```

> "One increment = one deliverable. Could be a feature. Could be a bug fix. Could be a refactor. But it's COMPLETE or it's not shipped."

#### Why This Matters for AI

**[VISUAL: Claude reading spec.md]**

> "Here's the key insight: Claude reads spec.md. It sees the user stories. It understands the acceptance criteria. It generates tasks that SATISFY those criteria.

> Then when you run `/specweave:do`, Claude checks off tasks, which checks off ACs, which completes stories.

> It's not magic. It's structure. And structure is what makes AI productive."

#### Pro Tip: Keep Increments Small (2-3x Faster with Opus 4.6!)

**[VISUAL: Small vs large increment comparison + speed metrics]**

> "Quick tip that will save you HOURS: keep your increments small.
>
> 5-15 tasks. 1-3 user stories. Something you can finish in 1-3 days.
>
> Why?
>
> **For YOU**:
> - Easier to track progress (12 of 15 tasks done feels great!)
> - Faster feedback loops (ship something every few days)
> - Less overwhelming (know exactly what to do next)
>
> **For AI**:
> - Claude maintains better context with smaller specs
> - Fewer tasks = higher accuracy per task
> - Easier to validate acceptance criteria
>
> **GAME CHANGER: Claude Opus 4.6**
>
> Here's the thing that's absolutely transforming my workflow. With **Claude Opus 4.6** (released November 2025), the development speed has increased **2-3x** — some developers report even **5-10x** faster completions!
>
> The secret? Formulate small, well-defined increments, and Opus 4.6 can complete them almost **without manual interaction**:
>
> 1. Define clear user stories and acceptance criteria in spec.md
> 2. Let the Architect agent create the plan
> 3. Run `/specweave:do`
> 4. **Just review what's done** — Opus handles the rest
>
> I've had increments where I typed `/specweave:do`, went for coffee, and came back to working, tested, documented code. That's the power of small increments + Opus 4.6.
>
> **Anti-pattern**: 50-task mega-increment that runs for weeks. You lose context. AI loses context. Nothing ships.
>
> **Good pattern**: Small increments, quick wins, fast iterations. Each one COMPLETE before the next. With Opus 4.6, you're mostly reviewing, not hand-holding."

#### Universal Hierarchy Mapping (External Tools)

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison table]**

> "Now here's where SpecWeave gets REALLY powerful. Every tool has different names for the same things. JIRA calls it an Epic. GitHub calls it a Milestone. ADO calls it a Feature.

> SpecWeave maps them ALL to one universal hierarchy."

**[VISUAL: Mapping diagram appearing]**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> "See that? Your Feature in SpecWeave becomes an Epic in JIRA. A Feature in ADO. A Milestone in GitHub. ALL AUTOMATICALLY.

> Your User Story becomes a JIRA Story. An ADO User Story. A GitHub Issue. Same content. Different systems. Zero manual mapping."

#### Project Hierarchy (1-2 Levels)

**[VISUAL: Multi-project structure]**

> "For enterprise teams, you also have PROJECT hierarchy. SpecWeave supports two patterns:"

```
PATTERN 1: Single Project (Simple)
─────────────────────────────────
.specweave/
├── increments/         ← All work here
└── docs/

PATTERN 2: Multi-Project (Enterprise)
──────────────────────────────────────
.specweave/
├── projects/
│   ├── frontend/       ← Maps to FE JIRA project
│   │   └── increments/
│   ├── backend/        ← Maps to BE JIRA project
│   │   └── increments/
│   └── mobile/         ← Maps to MOBILE ADO area path
│       └── increments/
└── docs/
```

> "If you have separate JIRA projects for frontend, backend, mobile — SpecWeave maps them. If you use ADO area paths for team separation — SpecWeave maps them. If you have multiple GitHub repos in an umbrella — SpecWeave maps them.

> One framework. Any structure. Enterprise-grade."

#### Why This Matters

> "Without this mapping, you're doing mental translation. 'Okay, my spec is a JIRA Epic... no wait, it's a Story... let me check ADO...'

> With SpecWeave: one command, correct mapping, every tool. That's the enterprise power other frameworks don't have."

### PROJECT-AWARE SYNC & THE /NEXT FLOW (16:30 - 20:30)

**[VISUAL: Sync flow diagram animating]**

> "Okay, here's where it gets REALLY exciting. This is the part that took MONTHS to build. Project-aware synchronization."

#### How Increment Generation Works

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing /specweave:increment]**

> "When you run `/specweave:increment`, SpecWeave doesn't just create files. It UNDERSTANDS your project."

```bash
/specweave:increment "Add payment processing"
```

**[VISUAL: Behind-the-scenes flow]**

```
YOU TYPE: /specweave:increment "Add payment processing"

SPECWEAVE DOES:
1. Detects current project (frontend? backend? mobile?)
2. Reads existing specs for context
3. PM agent creates user stories
4. Architect agent designs approach
5. Tasks generated with AC links
6. Metadata tracks external IDs
7. Ready for /specweave:do
```

> "One command. Full spec. Full plan. Full task list. All project-aware."

#### The Sync Flow

> "See that? Bidirectional. You check a box in JIRA — SpecWeave sees it. You complete a task locally — GitHub updates. This is REAL sync, not one-way export."

#### The Magic: /specweave:next

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing /next command]**

> "Now the command that ties it ALL together: `/specweave:next`"

```bash
/specweave:next
```

**[VISUAL: Flow chart of /next decision tree]**

```
/specweave:next DOES:
│
├─▶ Is current increment done?
│   ├─ YES: Run quality gates (tasks/tests/docs)
│   │       └─ Pass? Auto-close increment
│   └─ NO: Continue working
│
├─▶ What's next?
│   ├─ Backlog items? Suggest highest priority
│   ├─ No backlog? Offer to plan new increment
│   └─ Blocked? Show blockers
│
└─▶ Keep clicking "next" until done
```

> "One command. It figures out what to do. Close this? Start that? Review specs? Just keep clicking next.

> This is the flow I use every day. Start morning. `/specweave:next`. Keep going until lunch. `/specweave:next`. It's INTUITIVE."

#### Sync Commands Reference

**[VISUAL: Command cheat sheet]**

```bash
# Full sync (tasks → docs → external)
/specweave:sync-progress

# Just GitHub
/specweave:github-sync

# Just JIRA
/specweave:jira-sync

# Just ADO
/specweave:ado-sync

# The flow command
/specweave:next
```

> "That's the sync system. Months of work. Battle-tested on real projects. And it just WORKS."

#### Skills — AI Knowledge Injection

**[VISUAL: Skill activation demo]**

> "Skills are markdown files that Claude loads automatically when relevant."

```yaml
# SKILL.md
---
name: specweave-increment-planner
description: Creates implementation plans for increments.
             Activates for: feature planning, increment,
             new product, MVP, build project.
---

# How to Plan an Increment

When user asks to plan work, follow these steps...
```

> "I say 'plan a new feature' — Claude sees the keyword, loads the skill, now it knows SpecWeave's way of planning.

> No prompting needed. No copy-paste. The knowledge is there when Claude needs it."

#### Slash Commands — User Actions

**[VISUAL: Command being typed]**

> "Slash commands are explicit actions. You type them, they run."

```bash
/specweave:increment "Add dark mode"    # Plan new work
/specweave:do                           # Execute tasks
/specweave:progress                     # Show status
/specweave:done 0001                    # Close increment
/specweave:github-sync                  # Sync to GitHub
```

> "Each command is a markdown file that expands into a full prompt. Claude executes it."

#### Hooks — Automatic Reactions

**[VISUAL: Hook flow diagram]**

> "Hooks fire automatically when events happen."

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "event": "PostToolUse",
      "match": { "tool": "Edit" },
      "script": "check-task-completion.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

> "Every time Claude edits a file, the hook runs. It checks: did this complete a task? Should we update tasks.md? Should we sync to GitHub?

> Automation without thinking about it."

#### The Plugin Ecosystem

**[VISUAL: Plugin list]**

> "SpecWeave ships as plugins you install:"

```
specweave              ← Core framework
specweave-github       ← GitHub Issues sync
specweave-jira         ← JIRA integration
specweave-ado          ← Azure DevOps sync
specweave-infrastructure ← DevOps/Terraform agents
specweave-testing      ← QA automation
specweave-ml           ← ML pipeline support
```

> "Install what you need. Ignore what you don't. No bloat."

```bash
# During init, select your plugins
npx specweave init .
# → Select: GitHub, JIRA, or ADO
# → Plugins auto-install
```

#### vskill — 41 Domain Expert Skills

**[VISUAL: vskill plugin grid animating in — 12 domains, 41 skills]**

> "But that's just the SpecWeave workflow plugins. Here's where it gets really interesting.
>
> vskill is our universal package manager for AI skills. 41 expert skills. 12 domain plugins. And they install to ANY of 49 agent platforms — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Codex, Gemini CLI, you name it."

```bash
# Install a domain plugin

#### Spotlight: Mobile App Store Automation

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing asc commands executing]**

> "The mobile plugin has a skill called `appstore`. It uses a CLI tool called `asc` — App Store Connect — a single Go binary that wraps Apple's ENTIRE App Store Connect API.
>
> Your AI agent can upload builds to TestFlight. Distribute to beta testers. Submit to the App Store for review. Manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. Upload screenshots — programmatically, no dragging files into a browser. Handle code signing. Pull sales analytics. Trigger Xcode Cloud builds. Even notarize macOS apps."

**[VISUAL: Command flow animating step by step]**

```bash
# Build with whatever framework you use
eas build --platform ios

# Agent takes over from here:
asc builds upload my-app.ipa --wait     # Upload to App Store Connect
asc publish testflight                   # Distribute to beta testers
# ... collect feedback, iterate ...
asc publish appstore                     # Submit for App Store review
```

> "The ENTIRE App Store Connect web portal — replaced by a CLI that returns structured JSON. The agent parses every response, makes decisions, and acts. No browser tabs. No manual clicking. No 'click here, wait, click there.'
>
> And it works with ANY mobile framework. Build your IPA with Xcode, Expo, Flutter, React Native, Capacitor — `asc` handles the delivery side."

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of other impressive skills]**

> "That's just one skill. The `testing` skill uses Maestro for YAML-based E2E tests across iOS AND Android. The `mutation` testing skill answers the question your code coverage number can't: 'would my tests actually catch a bug?' The `security:patterns` skill finds GitHub Actions injection attacks that generic linters completely miss.
>
> The `ml:edge` skill deploys models to phones — Core ML for iOS, TensorFlow Lite for Android. The `infra:github-actions` skill sets up OIDC authentication so you never store cloud secrets again.
>
> 41 skills. Each one is what a senior specialist would tell you on their best day."

**[VISUAL: vskill install terminal animation]**

> "One command to install. Security-scanned before installation — no exceptions. And they work in 49 different AI agents."

#### Framework Trade-offs — Be Honest

**[VISUAL: Pros/Cons balance scale]**

> "Now, let me be real with you. SpecWeave is a FRAMEWORK. And every framework comes with trade-offs. Let's be honest about them."

**The Pros:**

> "Full control. You own your specs. You own your files. Nothing is locked in a SaaS.
>
> Automation. Hooks fire automatically. Status syncs without thinking.
>
> Extensibility. 24 plugins. Growing ecosystem. Write your own skills.
>
> Flexibility. GitHub OR JIRA OR Azure DevOps. Swap at any time."

**The Cons:**

> "Some decisions are made for you. The folder structure. The naming conventions. The workflow phases.
>
> Learning curve. It's not 'just prompts'. You need to understand skills, hooks, commands.
>
> Opinionated. If you hate spec-first development, this isn't for you.
>
> Maintenance. Updates, plugin versions, occasional breaking changes."

**[VISUAL: Decision matrix]**

> "If you're building something serious — a product, a startup, enterprise software — SpecWeave pays dividends.
>
> If you're just hacking a weekend project? Maybe overkill. And that's OK."

#### Why This Architecture?

**[VISUAL: Comparison with monolithic tools]**

> "BMAD gives you prompts. SpecKit gives you templates. SpecWeave gives you a SYSTEM.

> Skills load knowledge on demand. Commands let you act. Hooks automate reactions. Plugins extend capabilities.

> It's not a script. It's a framework. With the pros AND cons of a framework."

### MCP SERVERS & CONTEXT7 (27:30 - 31:00) — NEW!

**[VISUAL: MCP architecture diagram]**

> "Before we install, let me show you something that makes SpecWeave 10x more powerful — MCP servers. If you've never heard of MCP, you're about to have a game-changer moment."

#### What is MCP?

**[VISUAL: MCP logo + Anthropic connection]**

> "MCP — Model Context Protocol — is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI to external tools. Think of it as USB-C for AI assistants. One protocol, infinite connections."

```

> "These aren't plugins you install and forget. They give Claude LIVE capabilities — browsing, database queries, documentation lookup — in real-time."

#### Context7 — The Documentation Problem Solver

**[VISUAL: Before/After comparison]**

> "Here's a problem every developer knows. You ask AI: 'How do I use the new React Native Activity component?'
>
> AI trained 6 months ago? It hallucinates. It gives you old APIs. It makes up function names that don't exist.
>
> With Context7? It FETCHES the current docs. Live. Up-to-date. No hallucinations."

**[VISUAL: Context7 in action]**

```typescript
// What Context7 does behind the scenes:
mcp__plugin_context7_context7__query-docs({
  libraryId: "/facebook/react-native",
  query: "Activity component for tab state preservation"
});
// Returns CURRENT documentation, not 6-month-old training data
```

> "React Native releases every 8 weeks. Expo SDK every 4 months. Without Context7, your AI is always behind. With it? Always current."

#### Installing MCP Servers

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing commands]**

> "Here's how to set them up. Two options."

**Option 1: Claude Code Marketplace (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install Context7 from marketplace
/plugin install context7

# That's it. Auto-discovered, auto-configured.
```

> "The marketplace is the easiest. One command. Done."

**Option 2: Manual MCP Configuration**

```bash
# Add Context7 manually
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp

# With API key for higher rate limits (free from context7.com)
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_KEY

# Add Playwright for browser automation
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
```

> "Manual gives you more control. API keys give you higher rate limits. Both work."

#### Recommended MCP Setup for SpecWeave

**[VISUAL: Checklist appearing]**

> "Here's my recommended setup for SpecWeave projects:"

| MCP Server | Why You Need It |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Context7** | Current library docs — stops AI hallucinations |
| **Playwright** | E2E testing with `testing:qa` skill |
| **Supabase/Postgres** | If using database — direct queries |
| **Vercel** | If deploying frontend — deployment management |

```bash
# My recommended setup
/plugin install context7
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
```

> "Context7 is mandatory in my workflow. Playwright if you're doing E2E. The rest depends on your stack."

#### Important: Who Makes Context7?

**[VISUAL: Upstash logo]**

> "Quick clarification — Context7 is NOT made by Anthropic. It's made by Upstash, an open-source company. It IS listed in Anthropic's official marketplace, has 40,000+ downloads, and it's free.
>
> Anthropic created MCP the protocol. Third parties create MCP servers. Context7 is one of the best."

#### Why This Matters for SpecWeave

**[VISUAL: SpecWeave + MCP integration]**

> "SpecWeave skills like `mobile-architect` and `frontend-architect` tell Claude: 'Before recommending React Native APIs, fetch current docs with Context7.'
>
> The skill provides patterns. Context7 provides current versions. Together? You get advice that actually works today, not 6 months ago."

**[VISUAL: Code showing the integration]**

```markdown
# In mobile-architect AGENT.md:

## CRITICAL: Fetching Current Documentation

Before providing version-specific guidance, ALWAYS fetch:

mcp__plugin_context7_context7__resolve-library-id({
  libraryName: "react-native",
  query: "React Native latest version features"
});
```

> "This is built into SpecWeave's skills. You just need to install Context7, and the magic happens automatically."

#### MCP Server Installation (Cross-Platform)

**[VISUAL: MCP installation commands]**

> "After init, you can always add more MCP servers. These commands work on Mac, Windows, AND Linux:"

```bash
# Essential (install these!)
/plugin install context7

# Browser automation (for E2E testing)
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest

# Database access (if you use Postgres/Supabase)
claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
```

> "MCP servers are cross-platform. Same commands everywhere. Node.js required for npx."

#### The Skill Discovery Problem — Real Talk

**[VISUAL: Scrolling through MCP marketplace / npm search results]**

> "Now here's something nobody talks about. Finding the RIGHT MCP server or skill? It's hard.
>
> We're constantly adding skills to SpecWeave — we have over 100 now — and we're always working to make discovery easier. But the broader MCP ecosystem? It's the Wild West.
>
> I've installed skills that looked promising and they just... never stop. They exceed the token budget, burn through your usage, and produce nothing useful. You sit there watching your API credits drain while the agent loops in circles."

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing a skill spinning with no output — fast-forward effect]**

> "So let me save you some pain. When you're evaluating an MCP server, look for:
>
> - **Focused scope** — does one thing well, not everything poorly
> - **Reasonable token usage** — shouldn't eat your entire context window
> - **Active maintenance** — check the last commit date
>
> Here's a great example that's hard to find in 'most popular' lists but is genuinely one of the best for what it does."

#### Quick Demo: Excalidraw MCP — Diagrams on the Fly

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing installation]**

```bash
# One command to install
npx mcp_excalidraw
```

> "Excalidraw MCP. You can create diagrams on the fly — architecture diagrams, flowcharts, wireframes — directly from Claude Code. No browser, no copy-paste, no context switching.
>
> Let me show you a quick demo with vskill."

**[VISUAL: Live demo — Claude generating an Excalidraw diagram via MCP]**

> "See? Focused. Fast. Doesn't burn tokens. THAT's what a good MCP server looks like.
>
> The takeaway: don't just install everything. Be selective. Test before you trust. And if you find a good one that nobody's talking about — share it with the community."

### VS CODE + 4-TERMINAL SETUP (40:00 - 44:00)

**[VISUAL: VS Code opening]**

> "Now the productivity multiplier. I run four terminals. Every terminal auto-launches Claude. Here's the setup."

#### Installing VS Code

```bash
# Mac
brew install --cask visual-studio-code

# Windows
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
```

#### Auto-Launch Claude Configuration

> "Open VS Code settings. Search 'settings.json'. Add this:"

**[VISUAL: settings.json file]**

**Mac:**
```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
        "zsh": {
            "path": "zsh",
            "args": ["-i", "-c", "claude && exec zsh"]
        }
    },
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "zsh",
    "security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles": "open"
}
```

**Windows:**
```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
        "PowerShell": {
            "source": "PowerShell",
            "args": ["-NoExit", "-Command", "claude"]
        }
    },
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell"
}
```

> "Now every new terminal starts with Claude ready."

#### The Skip-Permissions Trick (VS Code Extension - RECOMMENDED!)

**[VISUAL: VS Code settings.json]**

> "By default, Claude asks permission for everything. If you're using the **VS Code extension** (which I highly recommend!), there's an undocumented but super helpful way to bypass permissions.
>
> Add these settings to your VS Code `settings.json`:"

```json
{
  "claudeCode.allowDangerouslySkipPermissions": true,
  "claudeCode.initialPermissionMode": "bypassPermissions"
}
```

> "This is WAY better than the terminal approach because:
> - It's per-project or global in VS Code settings
> - No shell function needed
> - Works automatically every time you open VS Code
>
> **Note**: There's a known issue where VS Code extension can sometimes hang or become unresponsive. If that happens, check this GitHub issue for workarounds: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12604
>
> Quick fixes if you hit that bug:
> - Restart VS Code Extension Host (Cmd+Shift+P → 'Developer: Restart Extension Host')
> - Close extra tabs/files to reduce diagnostics payload
> - Or fall back to terminal mode for long sessions"

#### Alternative: Terminal Skip-Permissions (if not using VS Code extension)

**[VISUAL: ~/.zshrc file]**

> "If you're using the terminal directly instead of VS Code extension, add this to `.zshrc`:"

```bash
function claude() {
    command claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "$@"
}
```

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

> "Now Claude reads and writes without asking. Only use this in YOUR projects."

#### My 4-Terminal Layout

**[VISUAL: VS Code with 4 terminals split]**

> "Here's how I actually work. Four terminals, each with its own Claude session. Let me show you how to set this up."

**Creating Multiple Terminals:**

> "In VS Code, use **Cmd+\\** (Mac) or **Ctrl+\\** (Windows) to split your terminal. Or click the split icon in the terminal panel.

> Quick note: **Cmd+\\** might conflict with 1Password's autofill shortcut. If nothing happens when you press it, check your 1Password settings and change one of the shortcuts.

> To create a NEW terminal (not split), use **Ctrl+Shift+\`** (backtick). Each new terminal auto-launches Claude with our config."

**[VISUAL: Demonstrating terminal creation]**

```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│   TERMINAL 1            │   TERMINAL 2            │
│   Claude - Main         │   Claude - Research     │
│   (building features)   │   (exploring, asking)   │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│   TERMINAL 3            │   TERMINAL 4            │
│   Tests (watch)         │   Dev Server            │
│   npm test --watch      │   npm run dev           │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

> "Here's why this matters:

> **Terminal 1** — Your main Claude. This is where you do the actual work. `/specweave:do`, implementing features, writing code.

> **Terminal 2** — Research Claude. Ask questions without interrupting your main work. 'Hey Claude, how does this API work?' Your main session stays focused.

> **Terminal 3** — Tests running in watch mode. Every save triggers tests. Instant feedback.

> **Terminal 4** — Dev server logs. See errors immediately.

> The magic? Each Claude session is INDEPENDENT. Different context. Different conversation. You can have one Claude building a feature while another one helps you understand the codebase.

> Never context-switch. Never lose focus. This is how I ship features 3x faster."

**[VISUAL: Demo showing all 4 terminals active]**

### DEMO 1: GREENFIELD PROJECT (31:00 - 43:00)

**[VISUAL: Empty folder in terminal]**

> "Let's build something from scratch. A real project. A task management API."

#### Step 1: Initialize

```bash
mkdir task-api && cd task-api
npm init -y
npx specweave init .
```

**[VISUAL: Init wizard running]**

> "SpecWeave asks a few questions:
> - Project name
> - Git provider (GitHub, JIRA, ADO, or none)
> - Testing framework
> - That's it."

#### Step 2: Plan First Increment

**[VISUAL: Claude running /specweave:increment]**

```bash
/specweave:increment "Build REST API for task management with CRUD operations"
```

> "Watch what happens. Claude becomes your product manager."

**[VISUAL: Claude generating spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md]**

> "It creates:
> - `spec.md` — full specification with user stories and acceptance criteria
> - `plan.md` — technical implementation plan
> - `tasks.md` — actionable tasks with dependencies

> All structured. All linked. All tracked."

#### Step 3: Review the Spec

**[VISUAL: Open spec.md in editor]**

```markdown
# spec.md
---
increment: 0001-task-management-api
---
<!-- Feature ID (FS-001) is derived from increment number - not stored -->

## User Stories

### US-001: Create Task
As a user, I want to create a new task...

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC-US1-01**: POST /tasks creates a task
- [ ] **AC-US1-02**: Returns 201 with task object
- [ ] **AC-US1-03**: Validates required fields
```

> "Every user story has testable acceptance criteria. Claude will check these boxes as we build."

#### Step 4: Execute

**[VISUAL: Terminal running /specweave:do]**

```bash
/specweave:do
```

> "This is the magic command. Claude reads the spec, reads the tasks, and starts building.

> Watch — it's writing actual code. Creating files. Running tests."

**[VISUAL: Code being written in real-time, tests running]**

> "See the tasks.md updating? Each task goes from pending to in_progress to completed. Live."

#### Step 5: Check Progress

**[VISUAL: Progress output]**

```bash
/specweave:progress
```

```
Increment 0001-task-management-api
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Progress: ████████░░ 80% (8/10 tasks)

Completed:
✓ T-001: Set up Express server
✓ T-002: Create task model
✓ T-003: POST /tasks endpoint
...

In Progress:
→ T-009: Add validation middleware

Pending:
○ T-010: Write integration tests
```

> "Real-time progress. No guessing. No asking 'where are we?'"

#### Step 6: Close the Increment

**[VISUAL: Closing increment]**

```bash
/specweave:done 0001
```

> "SpecWeave validates:
> - All tasks completed?
> - Tests passing?
> - Acceptance criteria checked?

> If anything's missing, it tells you. No incomplete work ships."

**[VISUAL: Show final project structure]**

> "In 12 minutes: a complete API with specs, tests, documentation. All synced. All tracked."

### DEMO 2: TRANSLATION FEATURE (43:00 - 48:00)

**[VISUAL: Existing project with i18n need]**

> "SpecWeave isn't just for code. Let me show you the translation skill."

#### The Problem

> "Your app is English-only. Marketing says: 'We need Spanish, German, French. Yesterday.'

> Translation is tedious. File by file. Key by key. Easy to miss things."

#### SpecWeave Translation

**[VISUAL: Translation command]**

```bash
/specweave:translate --target es,de,fr
```

> "One command. Watch."

**[VISUAL: Files being created/updated]**

> "SpecWeave:
> - Finds all translatable content
> - Generates language files
> - Maintains consistency
> - Uses Claude's native language understanding

> Not Google Translate. Not copy-paste. Claude actually understands context."

#### Demo: Translate Increment Specs

**[VISUAL: spec.md being translated]**

```bash
/specweave:specweave-translate --increment 0001 --target ru
```

> "Even your specs can be translated. Teams in different countries read specs in their language. Code stays English. Specs go multilingual."

**[VISUAL: Russian spec.md appearing]**

> "Russian user stories. Spanish acceptance criteria. German documentation. One command."

### PRO TIP: React Native / Expo Module-Level Crashes

**[VISUAL: Error message appearing - "Cannot read property 'getLocales' of null"]**

> "Quick tip if you're building mobile apps with React Native or Expo. This saved me an ENTIRE DAY of debugging.
>
> The #1 cause of silent crashes in Expo Go? **Module-level code execution.** When JavaScript imports a file, ALL top-level code runs IMMEDIATELY — before React mounts, before providers wrap anything.
>
> Common crashes:"

**[VISUAL: Code examples appearing]**

```typescript
// ❌ CRASHES - expo-localization at module level
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization';
const locale = Localization.getLocales()[0].languageCode; // BOOM!

// ❌ CRASHES - react-i18next (has React dependency internally)
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({...}); // CRASH in Expo Go!

// ❌ CRASHES - AsyncStorage at module level
const theme = await AsyncStorage.getItem('theme'); // Can't await here!
```

> "The fix? Use alternatives that don't hit native modules at import time."

```typescript
// ✅ SAFE - Use Intl (always available, no native module)
const locale = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale.split('-')[0];

// ✅ SAFE - Use i18n-js instead of react-i18next
import { I18n } from 'i18n-js';
const i18n = new I18n({ en, es });

// ✅ SAFE - Lazy require inside functions
async function getTheme() {
  const AsyncStorage = require('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage').default;
  return await AsyncStorage.getItem('theme');
}
```

> "If your app white-screens with no error? Binary search debugging: start with just `<Text>Hello</Text>`, add providers ONE BY ONE until it crashes. That's your culprit.
>
> Full guide in the docs: `.specweave/docs/public/troubleshooting/react-native-expo-crashes.md`

### PRO TIP: Self-Improving Skills with Reflect (45:00 - 47:00) — NEW!

**[VISUAL: Split screen - wrong code vs correct code, skill file updating]**

> "Here's something that will FUNDAMENTALLY change how you work with AI. The Reflect methodology.
>
> Every AI — Claude, GPT, Gemini — has the same problem: it generates patterns from training data. But YOUR codebase has YOUR patterns. Your conventions. Your hard-won lessons from production bugs.
>
> What happens when the AI generates code that's technically correct but WRONG for your context?"

#### The Problem: AI Makes the Same Mistakes

**[VISUAL: Stripe webhook code example - wrong pattern]**

> "Real example from last week. I asked Claude to implement Stripe Connect webhooks. It generated this:"

```typescript
// ❌ AI GENERATED THIS - LOOKS CORRECT, BUT BROKEN!
app.post('/webhooks/stripe', async (req, res) => {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, secret);

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'checkout.session.completed':
      await confirmPayment(event.data.object);
      break;
  }
  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

> "This looks right. Standard Stripe pattern. But it's BROKEN for Stripe Connect with Direct Charge.
>
> Why? Direct Charge checkout sessions are created ON the connected account, not the platform. The webhook at `/webhooks/stripe` NEVER receives `checkout.session.completed` for Direct Charges!
>
> Payments silently fail. No error. No crash. Just... nothing happens."

**[VISUAL: Correct pattern appearing]**

> "The fix requires TWO webhook endpoints:"

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Platform webhook
app.post('/webhooks/stripe', ...);           // account.updated

// ✅ CORRECT - Connect webhook (CRITICAL!)
app.post('/webhooks/stripe/connect', ...);   // checkout.session.completed
```

> "I spent HOURS debugging this. But here's the thing — I only want to debug it ONCE."

#### The Solution: Reflect Captures Learnings

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing /sw:reflect command]**

> "After fixing the bug, I ran:"

```bash
/sw:reflect
```

**[VISUAL: Skill file updating with new pattern]**

```
Analyzing session for learnings...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Detected correction pattern:
  - Topic: Stripe Connect webhooks
  - Wrong: Single webhook endpoint
  - Correct: Dual endpoints (platform + connect)
  - Confidence: HIGH (explicit user correction)

✓ Saved to: .specweave/memory/api-patterns.md
  → "For Stripe Connect Direct Charge, ALWAYS use separate
     /webhooks/stripe (platform) and /webhooks/stripe/connect
     (connected account events)"

✓ Updated skill: specweave-payments/stripe-connect
  → Added "Critical Patterns" section
```

> "That's it. The learning is captured. The skill is updated. Next time ANY developer on my team asks about Stripe Connect, the correct pattern is there. No debugging. No silent failures."

#### Real Example: React Native Localization

**[VISUAL: React Native error screen]**

> "Another example that saved me HOURS. React Native localization.
>
> I asked Claude to set up i18n. It generated react-i18next — the standard library. Works great on web. Crashes on React Native."

```typescript
// ❌ AI GENERATED - CRASHES IN EXPO GO!
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({...});

// Error: Cannot read property 'getLocales' of null
```

> "Why? Module-level code execution. react-i18next has internal React dependencies that run at IMPORT time — before React mounts. In Expo Go, this crashes silently.
>
> The fix? Use i18n-js instead — pure JavaScript, no React dependency at module level."

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - No native module dependency
import { I18n } from 'i18n-js';
const i18n = new I18n({ en, es });
```

> "After fixing this, I ran `/sw:reflect`. Now the mobile-architect skill KNOWS:"

```markdown
# Learned Pattern (captured by Reflect)

## React Native i18n
- **NEVER use** react-i18next (has React dependency at module level)
- **ALWAYS use** i18n-js (pure JS, no crashes)
- **For locale detection**: Use Intl.DateTimeFormat(), NOT expo-localization at module level
```

> "Next time anyone asks Claude about React Native localization? It generates the RIGHT pattern. No debugging. No white screens. No wasted hours."

#### Why This Matters

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing learning loop]**

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> "This is COMPOUND improvement. Every correction makes the AI smarter for YOUR codebase. After a few weeks, you'll notice: Claude stops making the same mistakes. Because YOU taught it."

#### Commands

```bash
# Analyze session, extract learnings
/sw:reflect

# Enable auto-reflection on session end
/sw:reflect-on

# Check what's been learned
/sw:reflect-status

# View centralized memory
cat .specweave/memory/*.md
```

> "Pro tip: Run `/sw:reflect-on` once. Now EVERY session automatically captures learnings when you close it. Zero manual work. Continuous improvement."

#### The Bottom Line

> "Default AI generates patterns from training data. YOUR AI — with Reflect — generates patterns from YOUR corrections.
>
> Same tool. Different results. Because it learned from YOU."

### DEMO 3: BROWNFIELD WITH LIVING DOCS BUILDER (47:00 - 57:00) — NEW!

**[VISUAL: EasyChamp codebase opening]**

> "Now the real test. A brownfield project. Existing code. Existing mess. This is EasyChamp — my company's product. Real production code.

> And here's what's BRAND NEW in v0.28 — the Living Docs Builder. This is a game-changer. Watch."

**[NOTE TO VIEWERS]**
> "EasyChamp is proprietary — you can't access this repo. But the technique works on any project. Let me show you."

#### Step 1: Initialize with Pre-Flight Questions (NEW!)

**[VISUAL: Running init with smart prompts]**

```bash
npx specweave init .
```

> "Watch — SpecWeave detects this is a brownfield project and asks smart questions UPFRONT before any analysis starts."

**[VISUAL: Pre-flight prompts appearing]**

```
🔍 Brownfield Project Detected!

Additional documentation sources? (Notion export, Confluence, MD folders)
> /docs/legacy, ./wiki

Priority areas to analyze first? (comma-separated)
> auth, payments, api

Known pain points? (describe what's confusing)
> Authentication is a mess, nobody understands the payment flow

Analysis depth? [quick/standard/deep]
> standard (estimated: 2-4 hours)
```

> "These inputs guide the ENTIRE analysis. Priority areas get analyzed first. Pain points get special attention. You tell SpecWeave what matters — it focuses there."

#### Step 2: Background Jobs Launch Automatically (NEW!)

**[VISUAL: Terminal showing job launches]**

```
Launching background jobs...

✓ clone-repos (job-id: abc123)
  → Cloning 3 repositories in background

✓ import-issues (job-id: def456)
  → Importing from JIRA project EASY (2,847 items)

✓ living-docs-builder (job-id: ghi789)
  → WAITING for clone and import jobs
  → Then: discovery → foundation → integration → deep-dive → suggestions

Init complete! Monitor with: specweave jobs --follow ghi789
```

> "THREE background jobs. All running while you work. Clone repos. Import work items. And the star of the show — Living Docs Builder.

> See 'WAITING for clone and import'? That's the job DEPENDENCY system. Living Docs Builder won't analyze until it has all the data. Smart."

#### Step 3: Monitor Jobs (Real-Time Progress)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - terminal running specweave jobs]**

```bash
specweave jobs --follow ghi789
```

```
Living Docs Builder: ghi789
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Phase: discovery (2/6)
Progress: ████████░░░░░░░░ 47%

Scanning: src/payments/
Files analyzed: 1,247 / 2,650
Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
Modules discovered: 12

Rate: 23 files/sec

```

> "Real-time progress. Phase markers. File counts. ETA. I can go grab coffee and come back to GENERATED documentation."

#### Step 4: What Gets Generated (The Magic)

**[VISUAL: Generated files appearing in tree view]**

> "After 1-2 hours, you get THIS:"

```
Generated Documentation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/

```

> "That SUGGESTIONS.md is pure gold. Let me show you what's inside."

**[VISUAL: Opening SUGGESTIONS.md]**

```markdown
# Living Docs Builder: Suggestions

## Priority Zones (by work item density)
1. **payments/** - 47 linked JIRA items (HIGH)
2. **auth/** - 32 linked JIRA items (HIGH)
3. **api/** - 18 linked JIRA items (MEDIUM)

## Documentation Gaps
- [ ] No API docs for /api/v2/*
- [ ] payments/refund.ts - complex, no comments
- [ ] auth/oauth.ts - uses deprecated library

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Create increment: "Document payment refund flow"
2. Review deprecated oauth library (security risk)
3. Add API v2 endpoint documentation

## Sampling Notes
- test/ excluded (default)
- 847 files in low-priority modules (sampled 3/dir)
- Full analysis available with: --depth deep
```

> "ACTIONABLE suggestions. It tells you exactly what to document next. Where the gaps are. What's risky. This is WEEKS of manual analysis — done in hours."

#### Step 5: Work Item Matching (Killer Feature)

**[VISUAL: Module-workitem mapping visualization]**

> "Here's the killer feature — it matched your imported JIRA items to discovered modules."

```
Module-Work Item Mapping:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
payments/     → EASY-142, EASY-187, EASY-203... (47 items)
auth/         → EASY-089, EASY-124, EASY-156... (32 items)
api/          → EASY-067, EASY-098, EASY-112... (18 items)
utils/        → EASY-012                        (1 item)
```

> "Now I KNOW: payments has 47 work items. That's where the action is. That's where I should focus first. Data-driven prioritization."

#### Step 6: Continue with Enhanced Context

```bash
/specweave:increment "Refactor payment refund flow"
```

> "When Claude generates the spec, it reads the GENERATED docs. It understands your codebase from the analysis. It knows about the 47 JIRA items. It saw the gaps."

**[VISUAL: Spec being generated with rich context]**

> "See? References to payments.md. References to discovered modules. Pain points we identified. It's not guessing — it KNOWS your codebase."

#### Pause and Resume (For Long Analyses)

```bash
# Pause the job (saves checkpoint)
specweave jobs --kill ghi789

### DEMO 6: AZURE DEVOPS WITH HIERARCHY INTELLIGENCE (60:30 - 64:30) — NEW!

**[VISUAL: Azure DevOps board with SAFe hierarchy]**

> "Microsoft shops — Azure DevOps works the same way. BUT — here's what's NEW in v0.28: Intelligent Hierarchy Mapping."

#### The Problem (Before v0.28)

> "ADO has different process templates. Agile. Scrum. CMMI. SAFe. Each has DIFFERENT hierarchy levels."

**[VISUAL: ADO hierarchy comparison table]**

```
Process Templates:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Agile:  Epic → Feature → User Story → Task     (4 levels)
Scrum:  Epic → Feature → PBI → Task            (4 levels)
CMMI:   Epic → Feature → Requirement → Task    (4 levels)
SAFe:   Capability → Epic → Feature → US → Task (5 levels!)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

> "Before v0.28, SAFe was BROKEN. Capabilities ended up in Feature folders. Epics got lost. Total mess."

#### Auto-Detection (NEW!)

**[VISUAL: Init detecting process template]**

```bash
npx specweave init .
# → Select "Azure DevOps"
# → Enter organization, project, PAT
```

```
🔍 Detecting ADO Process Template...

Project: MyEnterprise
Organization: contoso
Process Template: SAFe (5 levels detected)

Hierarchy Mapping:
  ADO Capability  → SpecWeave Epic   (_epics/EP-XXXE/)
  ADO Epic        → SpecWeave Feature (FS-XXXE/)
  ADO Feature     → SpecWeave Feature (nested under Epic)
  ADO User Story  → SpecWeave US     (us-xxxe.md)
  ADO Task        → SpecWeave Task   (tasks.md)

Proceed with import? [Y/n]
```

> "It DETECTS your process template automatically. SAFe? It maps 5 levels to SpecWeave's 4-level structure intelligently."

```

> "Every feature knows its parent. Full traceability. Click to navigate the hierarchy."

#### Sync Commands

```bash
# Import with auto-detection
/specweave:ado-sync --mode import

# Export preserving hierarchy
/specweave:ado-sync --mode export --increment 0005

# Bidirectional with pull
/specweave:ado-sync --mode bidirectional
```

#### Area Path Support

> "ADO uses area paths for team organization. SpecWeave maps them:"

```
ADO: /MyProject/Team-Backend/API

### DEMO 7: EXTERNAL INCREMENTS — Work Starts in External Tools (64:30 - 68:00) — NEW!

**[VISUAL: GitHub Issues / JIRA / ADO boards with existing items]**

> "Here's a game-changer most frameworks miss entirely. What if work STARTS in your external tool — not in SpecWeave?

> Your PM creates a JIRA epic. A customer files a GitHub issue. Your manager assigns you an ADO work item. You don't create these — they're handed to you.

> SpecWeave handles this NATIVELY. Let me show you."

#### The Problem: External Work Items

**[VISUAL: Split screen - external tool on left, empty SpecWeave on right]**

> "Real scenario: Your PM filed this GitHub issue three days ago."

**[VISUAL: GitHub issue #786 displayed]**

```
GitHub Issue #786:
[Bug] External tool sync is not working when opening an increment

Labels: bug, high-priority
Assignee: you
Created: 3 days ago
```

> "You didn't create this. You didn't plan it. But now you need to work on it — with full spec-driven discipline. How?"

#### Step 1: Import External Items

**[VISUAL: Terminal running import command]**

```bash
/specweave:import-external --source github --since "7 days"
```

```
Importing from GitHub...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Found 5 new items:
  • #786 [Bug] External tool sync... → FS-118E/us-014e
  • #785 Feature request: dark mode → FS-117E/us-013e
  • #782 Performance issue in API   → FS-116E/us-012e
  ...

Imported to: .specweave/docs/internal/specs/specweave/

Note: These are READ-ONLY REFERENCES.
To implement, create an increment from the imported spec.
```

> "See that 'E' suffix? FS-118**E**, us-014**e**. That 'E' means EXTERNAL origin. SpecWeave tracks that this came from outside — not created here."

#### Step 2: Review Imported Specs

**[VISUAL: Opening the imported user story file]**

```bash
cat .specweave/docs/internal/specs/specweave/FS-118E/us-014e-bug-external-tool-sync.md
```

```markdown
# US-014E: [Bug] External tool sync is not working

**Origin**: 🔗 [GitHub #786](https://github.com/...)
**Status**: Open

## Description
[Bug content from GitHub issue...]

## Tasks
> **Note**: This User Story was imported from an external tool.
> Create an increment to implement, then tasks will sync here.

---
## External Metadata
- **External ID**: github#anton-abyzov/specweave#786
- **Platform**: github
- **Labels**: bug
- **Feature ID**: FS-118E
```

> "The spec is READ-ONLY. It mirrors the GitHub issue. You don't edit this — you CREATE AN INCREMENT from it."

#### Step 3: Create Increment from External Item

**[VISUAL: Terminal creating increment]**

```bash
/specweave:increment --from-external FS-118E/us-014e
```

```
Creating increment from external item...

External Source: GitHub Issue #786
Feature: FS-118E (External Tool Sync Issues)
User Story: US-014E

Generating spec.md with external context...
✓ Imported acceptance criteria from issue
✓ Linked to GitHub issue #786
✓ E-suffix preserved: 0118E-external-tool-sync-fix

Architect agent creating plan.md...
✓ Analyzed codebase for affected files
✓ Generated implementation approach

Tasks generated: 6 tasks in tasks.md
✓ T-001: Investigate root cause
✓ T-002: Add sync trigger on increment start
...

Increment ready: .specweave/increments/0118E-external-tool-sync-fix/
```

> "Notice the increment number: 0118**E**. The E-suffix carries through. When this syncs back to GitHub, everyone knows it originated externally."

#### Step 4: Work Normally

**[VISUAL: Standard SpecWeave workflow]**

```bash
/specweave:do
```

> "Now you work exactly like any other increment. Read the spec. Complete tasks. Check off acceptance criteria.

> But here's the magic — when you complete tasks..."

**[VISUAL: Split screen - tasks.md updating AND GitHub issue updating]**

```
Task T-003 completed!

Syncing to external tool...
✓ GitHub Issue #786: Checklist updated (3/6 complete)
✓ Comment posted: "Progress update: T-003 completed"
```

> "The GitHub issue updates automatically. Your PM sees real-time progress without checking SpecWeave."

#### Step 5: Close and Sync Back

```bash
/specweave:done 0118E
```

```
Closing increment 0118E-external-tool-sync-fix...

Quality Gates:
✓ All 6 tasks completed
✓ All acceptance criteria checked
✓ Tests passing

External Sync:
✓ GitHub Issue #786: Closed with summary
✓ Comment: "Resolved in increment 0118E - see PR #789"

Increment archived to: _archive/0118E-external-tool-sync-fix/
```

> "The GitHub issue closes automatically. Your PM gets notified. Full audit trail. Zero manual copying."

### AGENT.MD — NON-CLAUDE AI TOOLS (66:30 - 68:30)

**[VISUAL: Multiple AI logos - GPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.]**

> "Here's a question I get: 'What if I don't use Claude? What if my team uses GPT? Or Gemini? Or Copilot?'

> Good news: SpecWeave still works. Here's how."

#### The AGENT.md Workaround

**[VISUAL: AGENT.md file]**

> "Any AI that reads markdown can use SpecWeave. You just need to give it context."

```markdown
# AGENT.md (put in your project root)

## Project Context

This project uses SpecWeave for spec-driven development.

## Key Files

- `.specweave/increments/` - Active work units
- Current increment: `0042-user-auth/`
  - `spec.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - `tasks.md` - Task list with status

## How to Work

1. Read `spec.md` to understand requirements
2. Read `tasks.md` to see current progress
3. When completing a task, update its status in `tasks.md`:
   - Change `[ ] pending` to `[x] completed`
4. Link your changes to acceptance criteria

## Task Format

When updating tasks.md, use this format:
```
### T-001: Task name
**Satisfies**: AC-US1-01
**Status**: [x] completed
```
```

> "This file teaches ANY AI how to work with SpecWeave. GPT reads it. Gemini reads it. Even basic assistants can follow it."

#### Why This Works

**[VISUAL: Diagram showing AI reading AGENT.md]**

> "SpecWeave's power isn't in Claude magic. It's in STRUCTURE.

> - specs.md is just markdown
> - tasks.md is just markdown
> - Acceptance criteria are just checkboxes

> Any AI that can read and write markdown can participate."

> "Claude Code gets the BEST experience — slash commands, hooks, skills. But any AI can read the specs and update the tasks."

#### Team with Mixed AI Tools

**[VISUAL: Team icons with different AI tools]**

> "Real scenario: Your team has different preferences.

> - Sarah uses Claude Code (full integration)
> - Mike uses GPT-4 with AGENT.md
> - Alex uses Copilot for quick edits

> Everyone works on the same specs. Same tasks.md. Same acceptance criteria. The sync still works. The structure doesn't care which AI wrote the code."

#### Setting Up AGENT.md

**[VISUAL: Quick setup steps]**

```bash
# Copy template
cp .specweave/templates/AGENT.md ./AGENT.md

# Or create minimal version
cat > AGENT.md << 'EOF'
# AI Agent Context

Read `.specweave/increments/*/spec.md` for requirements.
Update `.specweave/increments/*/tasks.md` when completing work.
Mark tasks as `[x] completed` when done.
EOF
```

> "30 seconds. Now your project works with any AI."

#### Best of Both Worlds

> "Use Claude Code for the full experience:
> - Slash commands
> - Auto-sync hooks
> - Plugin ecosystem

> Use AGENT.md for compatibility:
> - Team members with different tools
> - Quick edits in any AI
> - CI/CD integrations

> SpecWeave doesn't lock you in. It gives you structure that works everywhere."

### SPECWEAVE ACADEMY (68:30 - 70:00)

**[VISUAL: Academy page / docs structure]**

> "Everything you just saw is documented. Free. Open source."

#### What's in the Academy

**[VISUAL: Folder structure]**

```
.specweave/docs/public/academy/
├── videos/           # Scripts for every video
├── guides/           # Step-by-step tutorials
└── reference/        # Command documentation
```

> "This video's script? It's there. Every config I showed? It's there. Copy-paste ready."

#### Where to Find Everything

**[VISUAL: URLs appearing]**

> "GitHub: All public repos — github.com/anton-abyzov/specweave
>
> Docs: spec-weave.com
>
> Academy: In the repo under .specweave/docs/public/academy/
>
> Everything except EasyChamp is public. Clone it. Fork it. Learn from it."

#### Learn the Foundation

> "The Academy teaches more than SpecWeave. It teaches:
> - Spec-driven development principles
> - Software engineering fundamentals
> - AI-assisted workflows
> - Real production patterns

> This isn't just a tool. It's a methodology. And you can learn all of it for free."

#### Staying Updated

**[VISUAL: Browser tabs showing the 3 key resources]**

> "AI tooling moves FAST. Claude Code ships updates constantly. Here's how I stay on top of it:

> **Three resources I check daily:**

> **First** — Boris Cherny's Twitter: https://x.com/bcherny — Boris is the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic. This is where I learn about new features before they even hit the changelog. When I see Boris tweet about something, I know it's coming to Claude Code soon.

> **Second** — The Claude Code changelog: github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md — This is the source of truth for what's shipping. I read this every day to understand what's new, what's changed, what's deprecated.

> **Third** — The Anthropic Engineering blog: anthropic.com/engineering — New articles don't drop often, but when they do, they're gold. Deep dives into how Claude works, new capabilities, best practices straight from the team that builds it.

> Bookmark these. Check them regularly. The AI landscape changes weekly. You want to be ahead of the curve, not behind it."

---

### OUTRO (70:00 - 71:00)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - all 4 terminals + final code]**

> "Okay. That was A LOT.

> I'm not gonna lie — building SpecWeave was MASSIVE. 90+ increments now. Thousands of lines of code. And honestly? It was exhausting. But SO worth it."

**[VISUAL: Quick montage of features shown]**

> "Let me recap what you just saw:

> 15+ AI agents that orchestrate themselves. Enterprise hierarchy mapping — even SAFe with 5 levels. BIDIRECTIONAL sync that pulls changes back from JIRA, GitHub, Azure DevOps. Background jobs that clone repos, import items, and BUILD DOCUMENTATION automatically. Multi-language translation. Support for ANY AI tool. Not just Claude — GPT, Gemini, Copilot.

> This is the framework I wished existed when I started. Now it does. And it's FREE. Open source. No catch."

**[VISUAL: GitHub repo star animation]**

> "If this helped you — even a little — I need you to do a few things:

> ONE: Star the GitHub repo. Seriously. Stars are how developers find tools. Every star helps someone else discover SpecWeave.

> TWO: Subscribe and hit the bell. I'm at 140 subscribers. Help me get to 1,000 so I can keep making content like this.

> THREE: I want to hear from YOU. This is the most important one.

> Open an issue on GitHub. Drop a comment below. Tell me what problems you're running into. What features would make your life easier? What should I build next?

> Mobile app support? Better CI/CD integration? More AI tool integrations? Something I haven't even thought of?

> Your feedback literally shapes what I build next. I read every single issue. Every comment. This is open source — it's built FOR you, WITH your input.

> Got ideas? Got frustrations? Got a use case I didn't cover? I want to hear ALL of it.

> Drop a comment — tell me what demo was most useful. What should I cover next? Multi-repo? Advanced JIRA? Custom agents?

> Links in the description. This script is in the repo. Everything is documented.

> This was huge. Thanks for watching. See you in the next one."

## YOUTUBE DESCRIPTION

```
Finally. A framework that works on legacy codebases, startup MVPs, AND enterprise platforms.

I've worked on 10-year-old legacy code where nobody knows how anything works. I've built startup MVPs at 2am with zero documentation. I've navigated enterprise platforms with 50 microservices and SAFe hierarchies.

Every time, I thought: there HAS to be a framework that works on ALL of these.

There wasn't. So I built one. SpecWeave.

IN THIS VIDEO (~71 min):

THE PROBLEM:
• Why BMAD/SpecKit fail on real projects
• Documentation that always goes stale
• Tools that don't sync BIDIRECTIONALLY

THE SOLUTION:
• Drop SpecWeave into ANY codebase — it GENERATES documentation automatically
• Living docs that update themselves after every task
• BIDIRECTIONAL sync: JIRA ↔ GitHub ↔ Azure DevOps (pull AND push!)
• Background jobs: clone, import, analyze while you work
• Works with ANY AI: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Copilot

🆕 NEW IN v0.28:
• 🔄 BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC: External changes flow back to SpecWeave
• 📚 LIVING DOCS BUILDER: Auto-generate docs for brownfield projects
• 🔧 BACKGROUND JOBS: Clone, import, analyze in background
• 🏢 ADO HIERARCHY INTELLIGENCE: Auto-detect SAFe, Agile, Scrum, CMMI
• ⏸️ PAUSE/RESUME: Long-running jobs with checkpoints
• 🧠 REFLECT: AI learns from YOUR corrections — never repeats the same mistakes

9 REAL DEMOS:
• 🆕 Greenfield: Build from scratch
• 🌍 Translation: Multi-language in one command
• 🏚️ Brownfield: Living Docs Builder (auto-generate docs!)
• 🐙 GitHub: Bidirectional sync with pull
• 📋 JIRA: Enterprise epic/story integration
• 🔷 Azure DevOps: SAFe hierarchy detection
• 🔄 **External Increments: Work starts in ADO/GitHub/JIRA, implement in SpecWeave (NEW!)**
• 📊 Background Jobs: Monitor, pause, resume

BONUS:
• Works with GPT/Gemini/Copilot (not just Claude!)
• Full script in the academy (free)

⭐ STAR THE REPO: https://github.com/anton-abyzov/specweave
Stars help other developers find this!

LINKS:
• SpecWeave: https://github.com/anton-abyzov/specweave
• Claude Code: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code
• Academy: .specweave/docs/public/academy/

💬 I WANT YOUR FEEDBACK:
Open a GitHub issue or drop a comment! Tell me:
• What problems are you running into?
• What features would help YOU?
• What should I build next? Mobile app? CI/CD? More integrations?
Your ideas shape what gets built. I read everything!

## THUMBNAIL IDEAS

1. **Three icons + text**: 💀 Legacy → 🚀 Startup → 🏢 Enterprise + "FINALLY"
2. **Before/After split**: Chaotic tabs → Clean terminal
3. **Bold text overlay**: "Works on ANY Project" with surprised face
4. **Project montage**: Three project screenshots merging into one

**Text on thumbnail**: "FINALLY" or "Legacy + Startup + Enterprise"
**Colors**: Dark background, bright text (yellow/white), project icons
**Expression**: Relief/excitement (matches "Finally" emotion)

## PUBLISHING STRATEGY (Thanksgiving Nov 27, 2025)

### Timing Options

| Option | Time | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| **BEST: Morning** | 10:00 AM EST | Before family activities, devs scrolling with coffee |
| Good: Evening | 8:00 PM EST | After dinner, people relaxing, catching up on content |
| Alternative: Friday | Nov 28, 10 AM | Black Friday - people recovering, doing side projects |
| Alternative: Saturday | Nov 29, 10 AM | Weekend warriors, back to coding |

### Recommendation: **Publish at 10:00 AM EST on Nov 27**

Why Thanksgiving morning works:
- 🦃 People have time off but aren't with family YET
- ☕ Morning coffee + scrolling time
- 📱 Devs checking feeds before holiday chaos
- 🌍 Non-US audience unaffected (normal Thursday)
- 📈 Less competition (others avoid holidays)
