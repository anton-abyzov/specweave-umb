# YouTube Script: Stop Repeating Yourself

**Video Title**: "One Command = 10 Prompts | SpecWeave AI Coding Framework"
**Duration**: ~2-3 minutes
**Target**: Developers frustrated with repetitive AI prompting

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

How many times have you told AI the same thing?

"Add tests for that."
"Now document it."
"Update JIRA."
"Create a PR."

Every. Single. App. The same instructions. Over and over.

---

## PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:35)

Here's the dirty secret about AI coding tools: they make YOU the bottleneck.

You're not coding faster - you're DICTATING faster.
Every decision. Every step. Every app.

"Create authentication."
"Now test it."
"Now document it."
"Now sync to GitHub."

That's not automation. That's just... talking a lot.

---

## SOLUTION (0:35 - 1:00)

What if one command did what ten prompts used to?

```bash
/sw:increment "user authentication"
/sw:auto
```

That's it. SpecWeave runs for HOURS:
- Implements the code
- Runs tests
- Fixes failures automatically
- Updates documentation
- Syncs to JIRA and GitHub

While you sleep. Or grab coffee. Or build another app.

---

## PROOF (1:00 - 1:45)

I built 5 apps this way. But here's what proved it really works:

I taught my 10 and 14-year-old daughters to use SpecWeave.

They're building apps now. Not because they memorized what to ask AI -
but because SpecWeave has 15 AI agents built in:
- Product Manager
- Architect
- QA Engineer
- Security Expert
- DevOps

The expertise is IN the framework.

Skills auto-activate when you need them - just mention "security" and the security expert loads automatically.

Quality gates enforce what takes years to learn - tests before merge, docs before close.

---

## COMPARISON (1:45 - 2:15)

**Without SpecWeave:**
```
"Create user authentication"
"Now add tests for that"
"Document the architecture"
"Update JIRA with progress"
"Create the PR description"
"Run the linter and fix issues"
"Update the changelog"
```

7 prompts. Every single feature.

**With SpecWeave:**
```bash
/sw:increment "User authentication"
/sw:auto
```

2 commands. Done.

---

## CALL TO ACTION (2:15 - 2:30)

Stop repeating yourself. Stop being the dictator.

```bash
npm install -g specweave
```

One command. Hours of work. Ship while you sleep.

Link in description. Star on GitHub if this saves you time.

---

## B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS

- Terminal showing `/sw:auto` running with live status updates
- Split screen: left side = 7 prompts typed out, right side = 2 commands
- Dashboard showing JIRA/GitHub auto-syncing
- Kids using SpecWeave on laptop (if appropriate)
- Timer showing "2 hours later" with completed tasks

---

## THUMBNAIL IDEAS

1. "10 Prompts → 1 Command" with arrow
2. Person sleeping while code writes itself
3. "Stop Talking to AI" crossed out text
4. Split: frustrated person typing vs. relaxed person with coffee
