## Definition

**Greenfield development** refers to starting a new software project from scratch, with no existing codebase, infrastructure, or legacy constraints. The term comes from construction, where "greenfield" means building on previously undeveloped land.

In software, greenfield projects offer the opportunity to:
- Choose modern technology stacks without compatibility concerns
- Design clean architecture without legacy constraints
- Implement best practices from day one
- Avoid accumulated technical debt

---

## When to Choose Greenfield

### Good Reasons

1. **New Product or Company**
   - Building a new SaaS product from scratch
   - Startup launching first product
   - Exploring new market segment with dedicated product

2. **Failed Rewrite is Justified**
   - Legacy system is unmaintainable (technical debt > 80%)
   - Cost of maintaining old system exceeds rewrite cost
   - Technology is obsolete (no vendor support, security risks)
   - Business model has fundamentally changed

3. **Proven Product-Market Fit with Fresh Start**
   - Successful MVP being rebuilt for scale
   - Validated business model, need production-grade system
   - Moving from prototype to enterprise-ready product

4. **Strategic Business Decision**
   - New business unit with different requirements
   - Separate product targeting different market
   - Acquisition of technology requiring ground-up rebuild

### Bad Reasons

1. **"Clean Code" Syndrome**
   - Wanting perfect code (no code is perfect)
   - Developer preference over business need
   - Underestimating cost of rewrite
   - Ignoring value of existing system knowledge

2. **Avoiding Technical Debt Without Business Case**
   - Technical debt is manageable with incremental refactoring
   - Existing system still generates revenue
   - No critical scalability or security issues
   - Team can maintain and extend current system

3. **"Resume-Driven Development"**
   - Wanting to use new technologies for career growth
   - Following trends without business justification
   - Ignoring operational stability and team familiarity

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: New SaaS Startup

**Scenario**: Building a project management tool from scratch

```bash
# Initialize greenfield project with SpecWeave
npx specweave init my-saas-app
cd my-saas-app

# Start first increment
/specweave:increment "0001-user-authentication"

# SpecWeave guides you through:
# - Choosing tech stack (Next.js + Supabase + Vercel)
# - Designing architecture (microservices vs monolith)
# - Setting up CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
# - Establishing documentation patterns
```

**Benefits**:
- Modern tech stack (Next.js 14, React Server Components)
- Cloud-native from day one (serverless, edge functions)
- Best practices established early (testing, monitoring)
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Example 2: Microservices Migration

**Scenario**: Extracting a service from monolith as new greenfield service

```bash
# Legacy monolith (brownfield)
legacy-app/
├── user-service/     # Stays in monolith
├── payment-service/  # Extract to greenfield microservice
└── notification-service/

# New greenfield microservice
payment-service-v2/
├── spec.md          # Fresh architecture
├── src/
│   ├── api/         # Modern REST + GraphQL
│   ├── domain/      # Clean DDD patterns
│   └── infra/       # Kubernetes native
└── .specweave/      # SpecWeave tracks development
```

**Strategy**: Strangler Fig pattern with greenfield service

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Legacy as Legacy Monolith
    participant New as New Payment Service

    Note over Client,New: Phase 1: Build New Service
    Client->>Gateway: POST /payment
    Gateway->>Legacy: Forward to monolith
    Legacy-->>Client: Response

    Note over Client,New: Phase 2: Route New Traffic
    Client->>Gateway: POST /payment
    Gateway->>New: Route to new service
    New-->>Client: Response
    Note over Legacy: Old service deprecated

    Note over Client,New: Phase 3: Migrate Existing Data
    New->>Legacy: Migrate old transactions
    Legacy-->>New: Historical data
```

### Example 3: Failed Rewrite (What NOT to Do)

**Scenario**: Netscape rewrite (famous failure)

**Timeline**:
- **1997**: Netscape decides to rewrite browser from scratch
- **Reason**: "Code is too messy, let's start clean"
- **1998-2000**: Spend 3 years rewriting while competitors ship features
- **2000**: Release Netscape 6 (buggy, slow, missing features)
- **2002**: Mozilla switches to incremental approach (Firefox)
- **Outcome**: Greenfield rewrite killed Netscape's market share

**Lesson**: Greenfield is NOT always the answer. Consider incremental brownfield refactoring.

## SpecWeave for Greenfield Projects

SpecWeave is **optimized for greenfield development** with smart increment planning.

### Increment Skill

The `increment` skill automatically detects product descriptions and routes to increment planning.

**Capabilities**:
- Generate project structure from business requirements
- Suggest tech stack based on project needs
- Create initial SpecWeave increments
- Set up CI/CD templates
- Establish documentation patterns

### Greenfield Workflow

**Step 1: Initialize Project**

```bash
# Install SpecWeave globally
npm install -g specweave

# Initialize new greenfield project
npx specweave init my-app --greenfield

# SpecWeave asks:
# - Project type? (SaaS, API, CLI, library, microservice)
# - Tech stack? (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
# - Architecture? (monolith, microservices, serverless)
# - Hosting? (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel, Railway)
```

**Step 2: Plan First Increment**

```bash
# Create first feature increment
/specweave:increment "0001-user-authentication"

# PM agent generates:
# - spec.md (user stories, acceptance criteria)
# - plan.md (architecture, tech choices)
# - tasks.md (implementation tasks with embedded tests)
```

**Step 3: Implement with Living Docs**

```bash
# Execute tasks with AI assistance
/specweave:do

# After each task completes:
# - Living docs sync automatically (via post-task-completion hook)
# - Architecture decisions captured in ADRs
# - Diagrams generated and versioned
# - Tests run and coverage tracked
```

**Step 4: Iterate and Scale**

```bash
# Continue with next increments
/specweave:increment "0002-payment-processing"
/specweave:increment "0003-notification-system"

# SpecWeave maintains:
# - Complete project history (.specweave/docs/internal/specs/)
# - Architecture evolution (.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/)
# - Living documentation (always in sync with code)
```

### Key SpecWeave Features for Greenfield

1. **Increment-Based Planning**
   - Break project into manageable increments
   - Each increment = spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md
   - Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics

2. **Living Documentation**
   - Auto-sync docs after every task completion
   - Architecture decisions captured in real-time
   - Diagrams always up-to-date with code

3. **Test-First Development**
   - Tasks include embedded test plans (BDD format)
   - Coverage targets per task (80-90%)
   - TDD workflow mode supported

4. **Plugin System**
   - Load only relevant plugins (70%+ context reduction)
   - Tech stack plugins (specweave-frontend, specweave-backend)
   - Domain plugins (specweave-ml, specweave-payments)

## Best Practices for Greenfield Projects

### 1. Start with a Clear Vision

```markdown
# Example: Product Vision (spec)

## Problem Statement
Teams struggle with project management tools that are too complex.

## Solution Vision
Build a simple, intuitive project management tool focused on small teams (2-10 people).

## Success Metrics
- 1,000 active teams within 6 months
- 80%+ user satisfaction
- &lt;5 minutes to first project created
```

### 2. Establish Architecture Early

Use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** from day one:

```bash
# Example: ADR-0001-use-postgres.md

# ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need to choose a database for user data, projects, and tasks.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase).

## Rationale
- Relational data model fits our domain
- ACID guarantees for data consistency
- JSON support for flexible schemas
- Free tier sufficient for MVP
- Supabase provides managed hosting + real-time + auth

## Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB: No strong need for document model
- MySQL: Postgres has better JSON support
- SQLite: Not suitable for multi-user SaaS

## Consequences
- Strong data consistency
- Need to learn PostgreSQL (team familiar with MySQL)
- Supabase vendor lock-in (mitigated by standard SQL)
```

### 3. Implement CI/CD Early

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run lint

  deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run deploy
```

### 4. Use SpecWeave Increments

Break project into small, testable increments:

```bash
# Increment 1: Core infrastructure
/specweave:increment "0001-project-setup-and-auth"

# Increment 2: Basic features
/specweave:increment "0002-project-and-task-crud"

# Increment 3: Advanced features
/specweave:increment "0003-real-time-collaboration"
```

### 5. Document as You Go

Use SpecWeave's living docs system:
- Architecture decisions → ADRs (auto-synced)
- System design → HLD diagrams (Mermaid)
- API specs → OpenAPI (versioned)
- Runbooks → Operations docs (created before production)

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Over-Engineering

**Problem**: Building for scale you don't have yet.

**Example**:
```bash
# DON'T: Day 1 architecture
- Microservices (10+ services)
- Kubernetes cluster
- Event sourcing + CQRS
- Complex CI/CD with canary deployments

# DO: MVP architecture
- Monolith (Next.js + API routes)
- Vercel serverless hosting
- PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- Simple GitHub Actions CI/CD
```

**Solution**: Start simple, refactor when you have real scale problems.

### Pitfall 2: No Testing Strategy

**Problem**: "We'll add tests later" (never happens).

**Solution**: Use SpecWeave's test-embedded tasks:

```markdown
# tasks.md (auto-generated by test-aware-planner agent)

## T-001: Implement User Authentication

**Test Plan** (BDD format):
- Given valid credentials → When login → Then receive JWT token

**Test Cases**:
- Unit: validLogin, invalidPassword, missingFields
- Integration: loginEndpoint, sessionPersistence
- Coverage: 90% overall

**Implementation**: AuthService.ts, JWT helper, tests first (TDD)
```

### Pitfall 3: Documentation Debt

**Problem**: Focus only on code, ignore documentation.

**Solution**: Use SpecWeave's post-task-completion hook:
- Automatically syncs living docs after every task
- ADRs updated from Proposed → Accepted
- Diagrams regenerated from code changes
- Zero manual effort!
