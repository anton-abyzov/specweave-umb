# Enterprise Release Management & Versioning

:::tip Critical for Enterprises
Release management is the difference between chaos and control. This guide shows how SpecWeave tracks releases across environments, manages versioning, coordinates cross-team dependencies, and ensures compliance.
:::

---

## 🎯 Why Release Management Matters

### The Enterprise Reality

**Small Startups** (1-5 devs):
- Deploy to prod 10x/day
- No formal releases
- "Main branch is always deployable"

**Enterprises** (50-500+ devs):
- Deploy to prod 1x/week or 1x/month
- Formal release process (CAB, change windows, approvals)
- Coordinated across 5-15 teams
- Regulatory compliance (SOX, [HIPAA](/docs/glossary/terms/hipaa), PCI-DSS)
- Customer SLAs (99.9% uptime, scheduled maintenance)

**SpecWeave's Role**: Track increments → releases → deployments with full audit trail.

---

## 🏗️ Release Models

### Model 1: Sprint-Based Releases (Most Common)

**Cadence**: Every 2 weeks (sprint)

```
Sprint 24 (Nov 13 - Nov 27, 2025)
├── Increments: 0018, 0019, 0020, 0021
├── Release: v1.24.0
├── Deploy to: Dev (Nov 13) → QA (Nov 15) → Staging (Nov 18) → UAT (Nov 20) → Prod (Nov 27)
└── Stakeholders: Product team demos on Nov 26 (sprint review)
```

**SpecWeave Integration**:

```bash
# 1. Plan sprint
/sw:sprint create 24 --start "2025-11-13" --end "2025-11-27"

# 2. Link increments to sprint
/sw:sprint link 24 --increments 0018,0019,0020,0021

# 3. Track progress during sprint
/sw:sprint status 24

# Output:
📊 Sprint 24 Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Dates: Nov 13 - Nov 27, 2025 (14 days)
Days Remaining: 8 days

Increments:
  ✅ 0018: OAuth Integration (100%, deployed to Staging)
  🔄 0019: User Profile Page (75%, in QA)
  🔄 0020: Email Notifications (50%, in Dev)
  ⏸️  0021: Admin Dashboard (10%, planning)

Overall Progress: 59% (47/80 tasks completed)
Velocity: On track (38 story points, target: 40)

Blockers:
  ⚠️ 0019: Waiting for design approval (jane.smith@company.com)
  ⚠️ 0020: SMTP server not configured in QA

Next Actions:
  1. Unblock 0019 (chase jane.smith)
  2. Configure SMTP in QA (DevOps team)
  3. Complete 0020 by Nov 20 (3 days)
  4. Reduce scope on 0021 OR roll to Sprint 25

# 4. Create release at sprint end
/sw:release create v1.24.0 --sprint 24

# 5. Deploy release to prod
/sw:release deploy v1.24.0 --environment prod
```

---

### Model 2: Time-Based Releases (Monthly/Quarterly)

**Cadence**: Every month (or quarter)

```
November 2025 Release
├── Sprints: Sprint 24, Sprint 25
├── Increments: 0018, 0019, 0020, 0021, 0022, 0023, 0024, 0025
├── Release: v1.11.0 (November release)
├── Deploy to: Prod (Nov 30, 2025)
└── Includes: 8 features, 15 bug fixes, 3 performance improvements
```

**SpecWeave Integration**:

```bash
# 1. Plan monthly release
/sw:release plan v1.11.0 --month November --year 2025

# 2. Track increments throughout month
/sw:release status v1.11.0

# Output:
📦 Release v1.11.0 Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Target Date: Nov 30, 2025 (17 days away)

Features (8):
  ✅ 0018: OAuth Integration
  ✅ 0019: User Profile Page
  ✅ 0020: Email Notifications
  🔄 0021: Admin Dashboard (80%)
  🔄 0022: Dark Mode (60%)
  🔄 0023: Export Reports (40%)
  ⏸️ 0024: Advanced Search (20%)
  ⏸️ 0025: API Rate Limiting (10%)

Bug Fixes (15):
  ✅ 12 completed
  🔄 2 in progress
  ⏸️ 1 not started

Performance (3):
  ✅ Database indexing
  ✅ API response caching
  🔄 Frontend bundle size reduction (85%)

Release Readiness: 72% (58/80 increments completed)
Risk: MEDIUM (2 features may not complete)

Recommendations:
  ⚠️ Cut 0024, 0025 from release (roll to December)
  ✓ Focus on completing 0021, 0022, 0023
  ✓ Allocate extra QA time for 0022 (high complexity)

# 3. Finalize release scope (cut features if needed)
/sw:release scope v1.11.0 --cut 0024,0025

# 4. Deploy to prod
/sw:release deploy v1.11.0 --environment prod --date "2025-11-30 18:00:00 UTC"
```

---

### Model 3: Feature-Based Releases (Continuous)

**Cadence**: Whenever feature is ready (1-5x/week)

```
Week of Nov 13-19, 2025
├── Monday: Release v1.23.1 (Increment 0018: OAuth)
├── Wednesday: Release v1.23.2 (Increment 0019: User Profile)
└── Friday: Release v1.23.3 (Increment 0020: Email Notifications)
```

**SpecWeave Integration**:

```bash
# 1. Complete increment
/sw:done 0018

# 2. Create release immediately
/sw:release create v1.23.1 --increments 0018 --deploy-now

# Result:
✅ Release v1.23.1 created
   Increments: 0018
   Deployed to: Dev → QA → Staging → Prod (all green!)
   Duration: 2 hours (fast-track)
   Status: ✅ LIVE
```

---

## 📋 Semantic Versioning for Enterprises

### Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

```
v1.24.3
 │  │  │
 │  │  └─ PATCH: Bug fixes, hotfixes (backward compatible)
 │  └──── MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
 └─────── MAJOR: Breaking changes (NOT backward compatible)
```

### Examples

```
v1.23.0 → v1.24.0  (New sprint, new features)
v1.24.0 → v1.24.1  (Hotfix: Fix login bug)
v1.24.1 → v1.24.2  (Hotfix: Fix performance regression)
v1.24.2 → v1.25.0  (New sprint, new features)
v1.25.0 → v2.0.0   (MAJOR: API v2, breaking changes)
```

### SpecWeave Auto-Versioning

```bash
# Increment PATCH version (bug fix)
/sw:release bump patch

# Increment MINOR version (new feature)
/sw:release bump minor

# Increment MAJOR version (breaking change)
/sw:release bump major

# Auto-detect based on increments
/sw:release bump auto

# Auto-detect logic:
# - If any increment has "breaking: true" → MAJOR
# - If any increment has type "feature" → MINOR
# - If all increments are type "hotfix" or "bug" → PATCH
```

---

## 🔄 Release Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1 of Sprint)

```bash
# 1. Create release
/sw:release create v1.24.0 --sprint 24

# 2. Add increments to release
/sw:release add-increment v1.24.0 0018
/sw:release add-increment v1.24.0 0019
/sw:release add-increment v1.24.0 0020

# 3. Review dependencies
/sw:release dependencies v1.24.0

# Output:
🔗 Release v1.24.0 Dependencies
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Increments:
  0018: OAuth Integration
    ├─ Depends on: Database migration (0017)
    ├─ Blocks: User profile page (0019)
    └─ External: OAuth provider approval (in progress)

  0019: User Profile Page
    ├─ Depends on: OAuth Integration (0018)
    ├─ Blocks: Email notifications (0020)
    └─ External: Design system v2.0 (not ready!)

  0020: Email Notifications
    ├─ Depends on: User profile page (0019)
    ├─ External: SMTP server (not configured in QA!)

⚠️ BLOCKERS:
  1. Design system v2.0 not ready (ETA: Nov 18)
     Impact: 0019 cannot start
     Action: Escalate to design team

  2. SMTP server not configured in QA
     Impact: 0020 cannot be tested
     Action: Ticket to DevOps team

Recommendations:
  ⚠️ Risk: 2 blockers may delay release
  ✓ Option 1: Resolve blockers by Nov 15
  ✓ Option 2: Cut 0019, 0020 from release
```

---

### Phase 2: Development (Week 1-2 of Sprint)

```bash
# Track progress daily

  ✅ 0018: OAuth Integration (100%, ready for QA)
  🔄 0019: User Profile Page (45%, in dev)
  🔄 0020: Email Notifications (10%, blocked)

Blockers Resolved:
  ✅ Design system v2.0 ready (Nov 14)
  🔄 SMTP server in QA (ETA: Nov 15)
