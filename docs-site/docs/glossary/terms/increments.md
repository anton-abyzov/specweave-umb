# What is an Increment?

An increment is the fundamental unit of work in SpecWeave containing everything needed to plan, implement, and validate a feature.

## Structure

- **Unique ID**: 4-digit identifier (e.g., `0153-seo-enhancements`)
- **spec.md**: Specification with user stories
- **tasks.md**: Implementation tasks
- **plan.md**: Technical plan
- **metadata.json**: Status and tracking

## Lifecycle States

1. **Backlog**: Planned but not started
2. **Planned**: Spec completed, ready for work
3. **In Progress**: Currently being implemented
4. **Completed**: Validated and approved

## Why Increments?

- Clear, bounded scope
- Complete traceability
- AI-executable
- Living documentation
