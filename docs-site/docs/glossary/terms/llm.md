# LLM (Large Language Model)

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an artificial intelligence system trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text.

## Key Characteristics

- **Scale**: Billions of parameters trained on internet-scale text data
- **Generalization**: Can perform many tasks without task-specific training
- **Context Window**: Amount of text the model can process at once (Claude: 200k tokens)
- **Inference**: Using the trained model to generate responses

## Examples of LLMs

| Model | Developer | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Claude** | Anthropic | SpecWeave's recommended model |
| **GPT-4** | OpenAI | Alternative for some workflows |
| **Gemini** | Google | Multi-modal capabilities |

## Why This Matters for SpecWeave

SpecWeave leverages LLMs to:
- **Generate specs** from natural language descriptions
- **Plan implementations** with architectural decisions
- **Execute tasks** autonomously with code generation
- **Validate quality** through intelligent review
