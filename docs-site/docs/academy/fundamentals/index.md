## Recommended Path

**New to AI-assisted development?**
1. Start with [AI Development Fundamentals](./ai-development-fundamentals) - understand deterministic vs non-deterministic
2. Then [Enterprise App Development](./enterprise-app-development) - understand the big picture
3. Then [Software Engineering Roles](./software-engineering-roles) - know who does what
4. Then domain-specific guides based on your focus

**Experienced developer, new to LLMs?**
- Read [AI Development Fundamentals](./ai-development-fundamentals) first - key mental model shift
- Use other guides as reference when SpecWeave agents make recommendations

**Experienced with both?**
- Use these as reference when SpecWeave agents make recommendations
- Understand why the Architect agent suggests certain patterns

---

**Next**: [AI Development Fundamentals](./ai-development-fundamentals) - understand deterministic vs non-deterministic before building with AI.
