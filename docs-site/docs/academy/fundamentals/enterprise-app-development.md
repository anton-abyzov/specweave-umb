# Enterprise Application Development 101

## What is an Enterprise Application?

An **enterprise application** is a large-scale software system designed to operate in corporate environments, serving the complex needs of organizations rather than individual consumers. These applications are mission-critical systems that power core business operations.

### Common Examples

**E-Commerce Platforms**
- Amazon, Shopify, eBay
- Handle millions of transactions daily
- Manage inventory, payments, shipping, customer data
- Require 24/7 availability

**Banking Systems**
- Online banking, mobile banking apps
- Process financial transactions with strict accuracy
- Must comply with regulations (PCI-DSS, SOX)
- Handle sensitive customer data

**Healthcare Systems**
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Patient management systems
- Comply with HIPAA regulations
- Integrate with insurance, labs, pharmacies

**SaaS Platforms**
- Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Slack
- Multi-tenant architecture (one system, many customers)
- Subscription billing, user management
- High reliability expectations

**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**
- SAP, Oracle, NetSuite
- Manage company-wide operations (HR, finance, supply chain)
- Integration with multiple departments
- Long-term data retention requirements

## Why Enterprise Apps Are Different

Enterprise applications operate at a fundamentally different scale and with different constraints than personal projects or small applications.

### Comparison: Simple App vs Enterprise App

| Aspect | Simple App | Enterprise App |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Users** | Tens to hundreds | Thousands to millions |
| **Data Volume** | MBs to GBs | TBs to PBs |
| **Uptime Requirement** | 95-98% (some downtime acceptable) | 99.9%+ (43 minutes max downtime/month) |
| **Security** | Basic authentication | Multi-layer security, compliance (HIPAA, SOC 2) |
| **Team Size** | 1-5 developers | 10-100+ developers across multiple teams |
| **Lifespan** | 1-2 years | 5-10+ years (decades for some systems) |
| **Cost of Failure** | Minor inconvenience | Revenue loss, legal liability, reputational damage |
| **Testing** | Manual testing, basic [unit tests](/docs/glossary/terms/unit-testing) | Automated test suites, 80%+ [coverage](/docs/glossary/terms/test-coverage) |
| **Deployment** | Manual deploy, single server | [CI/CD](/docs/glossary/terms/ci-cd) pipelines, multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) |
| **Documentation** | README, inline comments | Comprehensive docs, architecture diagrams, [ADRs](/docs/glossary/terms/adr) |
| **Monitoring** | Basic error logs | Centralized logging, metrics dashboards, alerting |

### Key Characteristics

**Scale**
- Must handle peak loads (Black Friday, tax season)
- Database queries optimized for millions of records
- Infrastructure auto-scales based on demand

**Reliability**
- Redundancy (multiple servers, databases)
- Failover mechanisms (automatic recovery)
- Disaster recovery plans (backup data centers)

**Security**
- Defense in depth (multiple security layers)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance certifications required

**Maintainability**
- Code must be readable by new team members
- Architecture decisions documented (ADRs)
- Modular design enables safe changes

**Integration**
- Connect with third-party services (payment gateways, email providers)
- Internal system integrations (CRM, ERP, analytics)
- API-first design for extensibility

## Typical Enterprise Application Architecture

### The 3-Tier Architecture

The foundation of most enterprise applications is the **3-tier architecture**, which separates concerns into three distinct layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Presentation Layer (Client-Facing)"
        Web[Web Frontend<br/>React, Angular, Vue]
        Mobile[Mobile Apps<br/>iOS, Android]
        Admin[Admin Dashboard<br/>Internal tools]
    end

    subgraph "Business Logic Layer (Application)"
        API[API Gateway<br/>Entry point, routing]
        Auth[Authentication<br/>JWT, OAuth2, SSO]
        Services[Business Services<br/>User, Order, Payment logic]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer (Persistence)"
        DB[(Primary Database<br/>PostgreSQL, MySQL)]
        Cache[(Cache<br/>Redis, Memcached)]
        Queue[Message Queue<br/>RabbitMQ, Kafka]
        Storage[File Storage<br/>S3, Azure Blob]
    end

    Web --> API
    Mobile --> API
    Admin --> API
    API --> Auth
    API --> Services
    Services --> DB
    Services --> Cache
    Services --> Queue
    Services --> Storage
```

**Presentation Layer**
- User interfaces (web, mobile, desktop)
- Renders data from API
- Handles user interactions
- Stateless (no business logic)

**Business Logic Layer**
- Core application logic
- Business rules enforcement
- Data validation
- API endpoints

**Data Layer**
- Persistent storage (databases)
- Caching for performance
- Message queues for async tasks
- File/blob storage

**Benefits**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each layer can scale independently
- Easy to swap implementations (e.g., change database)
- Parallel development (frontend/backend teams)

### Modern Microservices Architecture

As applications grow, the monolithic business logic layer often splits into **[microservices](/docs/glossary/terms/microservices)**—small, independent services that each handle a specific business capability.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Layer"
        WebApp[Web Application]
        MobileApp[Mobile App]
    end

    subgraph "API Gateway Layer"
        Gateway[API Gateway<br/>Routing, Rate Limiting, Auth]
    end

    subgraph "Microservices Layer"
        UserSvc[User Service<br/>Authentication, Profiles]
        OrderSvc[Order Service<br/>Order Management]
        PaymentSvc[Payment Service<br/>Transactions, Billing]
        NotifySvc[Notification Service<br/>Email, SMS, Push]
        InventorySvc[Inventory Service<br/>Stock Management]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        UserDB[(User DB)]
        OrderDB[(Order DB)]
        PaymentDB[(Payment DB)]
        NotifyQueue[(Message Queue)]
        InventoryDB[(Inventory DB)]
    end

    WebApp --> Gateway
    MobileApp --> Gateway
    Gateway --> UserSvc
    Gateway --> OrderSvc
    Gateway --> PaymentSvc
    Gateway --> NotifySvc
    Gateway --> InventorySvc

    UserSvc --> UserDB
    OrderSvc --> OrderDB
    OrderSvc -.Event: Order Created.-> NotifyQueue
    PaymentSvc --> PaymentDB
    PaymentSvc -.Event: Payment Success.-> NotifyQueue
    NotifySvc --> NotifyQueue
    InventorySvc --> InventoryDB
    InventorySvc -.Event: Stock Updated.-> OrderSvc
```

**Key Principles**

**Single Responsibility**
- Each service does ONE thing well
- User service handles authentication, not payments
- Clear boundaries reduce complexity

**Independent Deployment**
- Update payment service without restarting user service
- Faster release cycles
- Reduced risk (isolated failures)

**Technology Diversity**
- User service in Node.js, payment service in Java
- Choose best tool for each job
- Gradual technology migration

**Decentralized Data**
- Each service owns its database
- No shared database (prevents coupling)
- Data consistency via events

## The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Enterprise applications follow a structured development process to manage complexity and ensure quality.

    style Operations fill:#fce4ec
```

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements

**Goal**: Understand WHAT to build and WHY

**Activities**
- Stakeholder interviews (business teams, customers)
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Defining success metrics (KPIs)
- Prioritizing features (MoSCoW method)

**Key Artifacts**
- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**: Business objectives, target users, success criteria
- **[User Stories](/docs/glossary/terms/user-stories)**: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **[Acceptance Criteria](/docs/glossary/terms/acceptance-criteria)**: Measurable conditions for done

**Example User Story**
```
As an e-commerce customer,
I want to save items to a wishlist,
So that I can purchase them later without searching again.

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-001: User can add items to wishlist from product page
- AC-002: Wishlist persists across sessions (logged-in users)
- AC-003: User can remove items from wishlist
- AC-004: User receives email if wishlist item goes on sale
```

**SpecWeave Integration**
- `/sw:increment "Add wishlist feature"` creates `spec.md`
- PM agent generates user stories with AC-IDs
- Traceability from requirements to tests

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture

**Goal**: Decide HOW to build it (technical approach)

**Activities**
- High-Level Design (HLD): System architecture, component interactions
- Low-Level Design (LLD): Class diagrams, [API](/docs/glossary/terms/api) contracts, database schema
- Technology stack selection (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architecture Decision Records ([ADRs](/docs/glossary/terms/adr)): Document WHY we chose X over Y

**Key Artifacts**
- **Architecture Diagrams**: C4 model (context, container, component, code)
- **API Specifications**: OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- **Database Schema**: ER diagrams, table definitions
- **ADRs**: Decision rationale (e.g., "Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB")

**Example ADR**
```
ADR-005: Use PostgreSQL for Order Database

Context: Need reliable transactional database for order management

Decision: PostgreSQL

Rationale:
- ACID compliance (critical for financial data)
- Mature tooling (pg_dump, replication)
- JSON support (flexible schema for metadata)
- Team expertise (faster development)

Alternatives Considered:
- MongoDB: No transactions, eventual consistency risk
- MySQL: Weaker JSON support

Status: Accepted
```

**SpecWeave Integration**
- Architect agent creates `plan.md` with HLD/LLD
- ADRs stored in `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/`
- Diagrams auto-generated with Mermaid

### Phase 3: Implementation

**Goal**: Write the code that implements the design

**Activities**
- Setting up development environment
- Writing application code
- Writing unit tests ([TDD](/docs/glossary/terms/tdd): test-first approach)
- Code reviews (peer validation)
- Continuous integration (automated build/test)

**Best Practices**
- **Small commits**: Atomic changes, easy to review
- **Branch strategy**: Feature branches, PR-based workflow
- **Code standards**: Linting, formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic

**Example: Feature Branch Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/wishlist-backend

# 2. Implement feature in small commits
git commit -m "feat: add Wishlist model"
git commit -m "feat: add POST /wishlist endpoint"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for wishlist service"

# 3. Push and create Pull Request
git push origin feature/wishlist-backend

# 4. Code review → approval → merge to main
```

**SpecWeave Integration**
- `/sw:do` executes tasks from `tasks.md`
- Embedded test plans (BDD format)
- AC-ID traceability (spec → task → test)

### Phase 4: Testing

**Goal**: Verify the system works correctly

**Testing Levels**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Testing Pyramid"
        E2E[E2E Tests<br/>10% - Full user flows]
        Integration[Integration Tests<br/>30% - Service interactions]
        Unit[Unit Tests<br/>60% - Individual functions]
    end

    E2E --> Integration
    Integration --> Unit

    style E2E fill:#ffebee
    style Integration fill:#fff3e0
    style Unit fill:#e8f5e9
```

**Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Fast (milliseconds)
- High coverage (80-90%)
- Example: `isValidEmail()` function

**Integration Tests**
- Test service interactions
- Database, API endpoints
- Moderate speed (seconds)
- Example: POST /users endpoint saves to DB

**[End-to-End (E2E)](/docs/glossary/terms/e2e) Tests**
- Test complete user workflows
- Browser automation ([Playwright](/docs/glossary/terms/playwright), Cypress)
- Slow (minutes)
- Example: User signup → login → add to cart → checkout

**Non-Functional Tests**
- **Performance**: Load testing (can handle 10K concurrent users?)
- **Security**: Penetration testing, vulnerability scans
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance (screen readers)

**SpecWeave Integration**
- Tests embedded in `tasks.md`
- BDD format: Given/When/Then
- Coverage targets per task (80-90%)
- `/sw:validate-coverage` checks completeness

### Phase 5: Deployment

**Goal**: Deliver code to production safely

**Modern CI/CD Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph LR
    Commit[Code Commit] --> Build[Build & Compile]
    Build --> UnitTest[Run Unit Tests]
    UnitTest --> IntegTest[Run Integration Tests]
    IntegTest --> Staging[Deploy to Staging]
    Staging --> E2ETest[Run E2E Tests]
    E2ETest --> Approval[Manual Approval]
    Approval --> Prod[Deploy to Production]
    Prod --> Monitor[Monitor & Rollback if Needed]

    style Commit fill:#e3f2fd
    style Build fill:#f3e5f5
    style UnitTest fill:#e8f5e9
    style IntegTest fill:#fff3e0
    style Staging fill:#fce4ec
    style E2ETest fill:#fff3e0
    style Approval fill:#ffebee
    style Prod fill:#c8e6c9
    style Monitor fill:#b2ebf2
```

**Environments**
- **Development**: Developer local machines
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production**: Live system serving real users

**Deployment Strategies**
- **Blue-Green**: Two production environments, switch traffic instantly
- **Canary**: Roll out to 5% of users, then 50%, then 100%
- **Rolling**: Update servers one at a time (no downtime)

**[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](/docs/glossary/terms/iac)**
- Define infrastructure in code ([Terraform](/docs/glossary/terms/terraform), CloudFormation)
- Version control for infrastructure
- Reproducible deployments

**SpecWeave Integration**
- GitHub Actions integration
- Automated living docs sync post-deployment
- DORA metrics tracking (deployment frequency, lead time)

### Phase 6: Operations & Monitoring

**Goal**: Keep the system running reliably

**Observability Pillars**

**Logging**
- Structured logs (JSON format)
- Centralized aggregation (ELK Stack, Splunk)
- Error tracking (Sentry, Rollbar)

**Metrics**
- Application metrics (request rate, latency, error rate)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Business metrics (revenue, conversions)
- Dashboards (Grafana, Datadog)

**Alerting**
- On-call rotation (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- SLA/SLO tracking (99.9% uptime)
- Incident response runbooks

**Example Alert**
```
Alert: API Error Rate > 5%
Current: 12% (120 errors/min)
Impact: Users cannot checkout
Runbook: https://docs.company.com/runbooks/api-errors
Assigned: On-Call Engineer
```

**SpecWeave Integration**
- Living docs stay current (post-task completion hook)
- Incident documentation (ADRs for root cause)
- Operational runbooks in `.specweave/docs/internal/operations/`

## Roles in Enterprise Development

Enterprise applications require diverse expertise across multiple roles:

| Role | Responsibilities | Skills | SpecWeave Agent |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Product Manager (PM)** | Define requirements, prioritize features, stakeholder communication | Business analysis, user research, roadmap planning | PM Agent (spec) |
| **Software Architect** | Design system architecture, technology decisions, ADRs | System design, scalability, trade-off analysis | Architect Agent (plan) |
| **Backend Developer** | Implement [APIs](/docs/glossary/terms/api), business logic, database design | Java, Python, [Node.js](/docs/glossary/terms/nodejs), SQL, API design | Tech Lead Agent (tasks) |
| **Frontend Developer** | Build user interfaces, client-side logic | [React](/docs/glossary/terms/react), [Angular](/docs/glossary/terms/angular), Vue, [TypeScript](/docs/glossary/terms/typescript), CSS | Frontend Agent (plugin) |
| **DevOps Engineer** | [CI/CD](/docs/glossary/terms/ci-cd) pipelines, infrastructure, deployment automation | [Docker](/docs/glossary/terms/docker), [Kubernetes](/docs/glossary/terms/kubernetes), [Terraform](/docs/glossary/terms/terraform), AWS/Azure | DevOps Agent (plugin) |
| **QA Engineer** | Test planning, automation, quality assurance | Selenium, Playwright, test frameworks | QA Agent (plugin) |

**SpecWeave Connection**
- Core agents (PM, Architect, Tech Lead) mirror real-world roles
- Plugin agents extend to specialized domains (ML, payments, infrastructure)
- Agents produce artifacts in standard formats (spec.md, plan.md, tasks)

## Common Enterprise Patterns

### 1. API-First Development

**Concept**: Design the API contract BEFORE implementing frontend or backend.

```mermaid
graph LR
    API[API Contract<br/>OpenAPI Spec] --> Frontend[Frontend Development<br/>Mock API responses]
    API --> Backend[Backend Development<br/>Implement API]
    Frontend -.Integration.-> Backend

    style API fill:#fff3e0
    style Frontend fill:#e3f2fd
    style Backend fill:#e8f5e9
```

**Benefits**
- Parallel development (frontend/backend teams)
- Clear contract prevents integration issues
- API documentation auto-generated

**Example OpenAPI Spec**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /wishlist:
    post:
      summary: Add item to wishlist
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                productId:
                  type: string
      responses:
        201:
          description: Item added
        400:
          description: Invalid product ID
```

### 2. Database-Per-Service (Microservices)

**Concept**: Each microservice owns its database, no shared database.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Service"
        UserAPI[User API]
        UserDB[(User DB)]
        UserAPI --> UserDB
    end

    subgraph "Order Service"
        OrderAPI[Order API]
        OrderDB[(Order DB)]
        OrderAPI --> OrderDB
    end

    subgraph "Payment Service"
        PaymentAPI[Payment API]
        PaymentDB[(Payment DB)]
        PaymentAPI --> PaymentDB
    end

    UserAPI -.API Call.-> OrderAPI
    OrderAPI -.API Call.-> PaymentAPI
```

**Benefits**
- Services can evolve independently
- Technology diversity (Postgres, MongoDB, Redis)
- Fault isolation (payment DB down doesn't break user service)

**Trade-offs**
- No SQL joins across services
- Data consistency challenges (eventual consistency)
- Distributed transactions complexity

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

**Concept**: Services communicate via events instead of direct API calls.

```mermaid
graph LR
    OrderSvc[Order Service] -->|Event: Order Created| Queue[Message Queue<br/>Kafka, RabbitMQ]
    Queue --> PaymentSvc[Payment Service]
    Queue --> InventorySvc[Inventory Service]
    Queue --> NotifySvc[Notification Service]

    PaymentSvc -->|Event: Payment Success| Queue
    Queue --> OrderSvc
    Queue --> NotifySvc

    style Queue fill:#fff3e0
    style OrderSvc fill:#e3f2fd
    style PaymentSvc fill:#e8f5e9
    style InventorySvc fill:#f3e5f5
    style NotifySvc fill:#ffebee
```

**Benefits**
- Loose coupling (services don't know about each other)
- Resilience (if inventory service is down, event waits in queue)
- Scalability (add more consumers for popular events)

**Use Cases**
- Order processing pipelines
- Real-time notifications
- Data synchronization
- Audit logging

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Concept**: Prevent cascading failures when a service is down.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed: System Normal
    Closed --> Open: Failure Threshold Reached<br/>(e.g., 5 errors in 30s)
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout Expired<br/>(e.g., 60s)
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Test Request Succeeds
    HalfOpen --> Open: Test Request Fails

    note right of Closed
        All requests pass through
        Failures counted
    end note

    note right of Open
        Requests fail immediately
        No calls to downstream service
    end note

    note right of HalfOpen
        Limited requests allowed
        Test if service recovered
    end note
```

**Benefits**
- Fast failure (don't wait for timeout)
- Service recovery time (stops overwhelming broken service)
- Graceful degradation (show cached data instead of error)

### 5. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**Concept**: Separate read and write operations into different models.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Client[Client] -->|Commands<br/>Create, Update, Delete| WriteAPI[Write API]
    Client -->|Queries<br/>Search, List, Get| ReadAPI[Read API]

    WriteAPI --> WriteDB[(Write DB<br/>Normalized)]
    WriteAPI -->|Events| Queue[Event Bus]
    Queue -->|Sync| ReadDB[(Read DB<br/>Denormalized, Optimized)]
    ReadAPI --> ReadDB

    style WriteAPI fill:#ffebee
    style ReadAPI fill:#e8f5e9
    style WriteDB fill:#fff3e0
    style ReadDB fill:#e3f2fd
```

**Benefits**
- Optimized databases for each use case (write DB normalized, read DB denormalized)
- Independent scaling (read-heavy apps scale read replicas)
- Complex queries don't affect write performance

**Use Cases**
- E-commerce product catalogs (millions of reads, few writes)
- Analytics dashboards (complex queries)
- Audit systems (append-only writes, complex reporting)

## Documentation Strategy

### Why Documentation Matters

**Knowledge Sharing**
- New developers onboard faster (30 days → 7 days with good docs)
- Team alignment (everyone understands the "why")
- Reduce bus factor (no single point of failure)

**Future Maintenance**
- "Why did we choose Redis?" → ADR explains the reasoning
- "How does authentication work?" → Architecture diagram shows flow
- 6 months later: "What did this code do?" → Inline comments help

**Compliance Requirements**
- FDA (medical devices): Traceability from requirements to code
- SOC 2 (security): Document access controls, incident response
- HIPAA (healthcare): Audit trails for data access

**Incident Response**
- Runbooks guide on-call engineers
- Architecture diagrams help diagnose issues
- Historical decisions (ADRs) provide context

### Documentation Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Strategic (Long-Term)"
        PRD[Product Requirements<br/>Business objectives, vision]
        ADR[Architecture Decisions<br/>Why we chose X over Y]
    end

    subgraph "Tactical (Medium-Term)"
        HLD[High-Level Design<br/>System architecture]
        API[API Documentation<br/>Endpoint reference]
    end

    subgraph "Operational (Short-Term)"
        Code[Inline Code Comments<br/>Implementation details]
        Runbook[Runbooks<br/>Incident response steps]
    end

    PRD --> HLD
    ADR --> HLD
    HLD --> API
    API --> Code
    HLD --> Runbook

    style PRD fill:#e3f2fd
    style ADR fill:#fff3e0
    style HLD fill:#e8f5e9
    style API fill:#f3e5f5
    style Code fill:#fce4ec
    style Runbook fill:#ffebee
```

**SpecWeave's Living Documentation**

Traditional problem: Docs become stale
```
Week 1: Write docs
Week 2: Update code, forget to update docs
Month 1: Docs are 50% wrong
Year 1: Docs are 90% wrong, no one trusts them
```

SpecWeave solution: Auto-sync after every task
```
Task completes → post-task-completion hook fires → living docs sync
- ADRs updated (Proposed → Accepted)
- Architecture diagrams regenerated
- API docs refreshed
- Always current, always trusted
```

## Real-World Example: E-Commerce Platform

Let's build a complete e-commerce platform to see how enterprise concepts come together.

### System Architecture

### Development Workflow with SpecWeave

**Phase 1: Planning**
```bash
# PM creates increment
/sw:increment "Add wishlist feature"

# Generates spec.md with:
# - User stories (US-001: Save items to wishlist)
# - Acceptance criteria (AC-US1-01: User can add/remove items)
# - Success metrics (wishlist adoption rate > 30%)
```

**Phase 2: Design**
```bash
# Architect reviews spec, creates plan.md with:
# - HLD: Wishlist table in Cart Service
# - API design: POST /wishlist, GET /wishlist, DELETE /wishlist/:id
# - Database schema
# - ADR: Why Cart Service owns wishlist (not User Service)
```

**Phase 3: Implementation**
```bash
# Tech Lead generates tasks.md with embedded tests:
# - T-001: Create Wishlist table (unit tests, 90% coverage)
# - T-002: Add POST /wishlist endpoint (integration tests, 85% coverage)
# - T-003: Add GET /wishlist endpoint (E2E tests, critical path)
# - T-004: Update frontend (Playwright tests)
# - T-005: Documentation update

# Execute tasks
/sw:do

# Claude Code implements T-001, T-002, etc.
# After each task: post-task-completion hook syncs living docs
```

**Phase 4: Testing**
```bash
# Validate test coverage
/sw:validate-coverage

# Output:
# ✅ T-001: 92% coverage (target: 90%)
# ✅ T-002: 87% coverage (target: 85%)
# ✅ T-003: 100% E2E critical path
# ✅ T-004: Playwright tests passing
# ✅ Overall: 89% coverage (target: 85%)
```

**Phase 5: Deployment**
```bash
# CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
# - Build → Unit tests → Integration tests → Deploy to staging
# - E2E tests on staging → Manual approval → Deploy to production
# - Post-deployment: Living docs sync, DORA metrics update
```

**Phase 6: Operations**
```bash
# Monitoring dashboard shows:
# - Wishlist creation rate: 1,200/hour
# - API latency: P95 = 120ms (target: &lt;200ms)
# - Error rate: 0.3% (target: &lt;1%)

# Living docs automatically updated:
# - ADR-012: Wishlist in Cart Service (Proposed → Accepted)
# - API docs: POST /wishlist endpoint documented
# - Architecture diagram: Wishlist component added
```

## How SpecWeave Supports Enterprise Development

### 1. Specification-First Workflow

**Traditional Problem**
```
Developer: "I'll just start coding, we can figure out requirements later"
Result: Scope creep, rework, missed requirements
```

**SpecWeave Solution**
```
PM Agent: Generate spec.md with:
  - User stories (what the user wants)
  - Acceptance criteria (measurable done conditions)
  - Success metrics (how we measure impact)

Result: Clear direction, no ambiguity, testable outcomes
```

**Benefits**
- Single source of truth (spec)
- Traceability (requirement → code → test)
- Stakeholder alignment (everyone approves spec first)

### 2. Architecture Documentation (ADRs)

**Traditional Problem**
```
6 months later: "Why did we choose MongoDB?"
Engineer: "I don't remember. The person who decided left the company."
Result: Fear of change, technical debt accumulates
```

**SpecWeave Solution**
```
Architect Agent: Generate ADR-005
  - Context: Need database for product catalog
  - Decision: Elasticsearch (not MongoDB)
  - Rationale: Fast full-text search, faceted navigation
  - Alternatives: MongoDB (slower search), PostgreSQL (no full-text)
  - Status: Accepted

Result: Historical record, rationale preserved forever
```

**Benefits**
- Onboarding (new engineers understand past decisions)
- Change decisions (re-evaluate with full context)
- Compliance (audit trail for regulations)

### 3. Test Traceability (AC-IDs)

**Traditional Problem**
```
QA: "This test is failing. What requirement does it test?"
Engineer: "I don't know. The test was written 2 years ago."
Result: Fear of deleting tests, bloated test suites
```

**SpecWeave Solution**
```
spec.md:
  AC-US1-01: User can add items to wishlist

tasks.md:
  T-002: Implement POST /wishlist endpoint
    AC: AC-US1-01
    Test Cases:
      - Unit: addToWishlist(userId, productId) → wishlist updated
      - Integration: POST /wishlist → 201 Created
      - E2E: User clicks "Add to Wishlist" → item appears in wishlist page

Result: Clear traceability from requirement to test
```

**Benefits**
- Understand test purpose (AC-US1-01 explains why this test exists)
- Safe refactoring (if requirement changes, update linked tests)
- Coverage analysis (/sw:validate-coverage shows AC-ID coverage)

### 4. Living Documentation (Auto-Sync)

**Traditional Problem**
```
Week 1: Write docs (accurate)
Week 2: Update code, forget docs (docs 20% stale)
Month 1: Docs 50% wrong
Year 1: Docs 90% wrong, no one trusts them
```

**SpecWeave Solution**
```
post-task-completion.sh hook:
  - Task T-002 completes
  - Hook fires automatically
  - Syncs living docs:
    - ADR-012: Proposed → Accepted
    - API docs: POST /wishlist endpoint added
    - Architecture diagram: Wishlist component added
    - CHANGELOG.md: Updated with new feature

Result: Docs always current, always trusted
```

**Benefits**
- Zero manual effort (automation)
- Always accurate (syncs after every task)
- Trusted source (team relies on docs)

### 5. Compliance Support (FDA, SOC 2, HIPAA)

**Regulatory Requirements**

**FDA (Medical Devices)**
- Traceability: Requirement → Design → Code → Test
- Validation: Tests prove requirements are met
- Change control: Document all changes

**SOC 2 (Security)**
- Access controls: Who can deploy to production?
- Audit trails: When was code deployed? By whom?
- Incident response: Documented runbooks

**HIPAA (Healthcare)**
- Data handling: Encrypt PHI (Protected Health Information)
- Access logs: Who accessed patient data?
- Compliance documentation: Policies, procedures

**SpecWeave Compliance Features**

```
AC-IDs provide traceability:
  SPEC-0005 (User Authentication)
  ├── AC-US1-01: User can log in
  │   ├── T-001: Implement AuthService
  │   │   └── Test: validLogin() passes
  │   └── T-003: Implement POST /auth/login
  │       └── Test: E2E login flow passes
  └── AC-US1-02: Failed login attempts are logged
      └── T-004: Implement audit logging
          └── Test: Failed login creates audit log entry

Audit trail:
  2025-11-04 10:30 - PM Agent creates spec.md
  2025-11-04 11:15 - Architect Agent creates plan.md
  2025-11-04 14:20 - T-001 completed (commit abc123)
  2025-11-04 16:45 - T-003 completed (commit def456)
  2025-11-05 09:10 - Deployed to production (v1.2.0)

ADRs document decisions:
  ADR-007: Why We Chose JWT for Authentication
  - Regulatory context: HIPAA requires secure authentication
  - Decision: JWT tokens (not session cookies)
  - Rationale: Stateless, scalable, audit trail in token
```

## Best Practices for Enterprise Development

### 1. Start Small, Iterate Often

**Don't**: Build the entire system before deploying
```
6 months development → Deploy → Realize requirements changed
```

**Do**: Ship incremental value
```
Week 1: Basic authentication → Deploy
Week 2: User profiles → Deploy
Week 3: Password reset → Deploy
```

**SpecWeave Support**: Increments naturally enforce small batches

### 2. Write Tests First (TDD)

**Don't**: Write code, then write tests as an afterthought
```
Code works → Tests pass (but are they testing the right thing?)
```

**Do**: Write tests first
```
Red (failing test) → Green (minimal code) → Refactor (improve code)
```

**SpecWeave Support**: `test_mode: TDD` in tasks.md, embedded test plans

### 3. Document Decisions (ADRs)

**Don't**: Make decisions in Slack/email, no record
```
6 months later: "Why did we choose X?"
Answer: "No one remembers"
```

**Do**: Write Architecture Decision Records
```
ADR-008: Why We Chose Polling Over WebSockets
- Context: Need real-time order updates
- Decision: Long-polling (not WebSockets)
- Rationale: Simpler, works with load balancers, fewer browser issues
```

**SpecWeave Support**: ADRs auto-generated, stored in `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/`

### 4. Code Reviews Are Mandatory

**Don't**: Merge code without review
```
Developer pushes to main → Production breaks
```

**Do**: Pull Request workflow
```
Feature branch → PR → Code review → Approval → Merge
```

**Best Practices**
- Small PRs (200-400 lines, easier to review)
- Clear description (what, why, testing done)
- Link to spec (AC-IDs)

### 5. Monitor Everything

**Don't**: Deploy and hope it works
```
Production breaks → Users complain → You find out hours later
```

**Do**: Proactive monitoring
```
Error rate spike → Alert fires → On-call investigates → Fix deployed
```

**Four Golden Signals** (Google SRE)
- Latency: How long requests take
- Traffic: How many requests
- Errors: How many requests fail
- Saturation: How full the system is (CPU, memory)

### 6. Automate Repetitive Tasks

**Don't**: Manual processes (error-prone, slow)
```
Developer: "Can someone deploy to staging?"
DevOps: "I'm busy, maybe tomorrow"
```

**Do**: CI/CD automation
```
Push to main → Tests run → Deploy to staging (automatic)
Manual approval → Deploy to production (one-click)
```

### 7. Use Feature Flags

**Don't**: Big bang releases (all-or-nothing)
```
Deploy new checkout flow → 20% of users can't checkout → Rollback
```

**Do**: Feature flags (gradual rollout)
```
Enable for 5% → Monitor → 50% → Monitor → 100%
```

**Example**
```javascript
if (featureFlags.newCheckoutFlow) {
  // New code
} else {
  // Old code (fallback)
}
```

### 8. Practice Blameless Postmortems

**Don't**: Blame individuals for incidents
```
"Who broke production?" → Fear, hiding mistakes
```

**Do**: Blameless postmortems (focus on systems)
```
"What systemic issue allowed this to happen?"
"How can we prevent this class of error?"
```

**Example Postmortem**
```
Incident: Database ran out of disk space
Root Cause: No disk usage monitoring
Fix: Add disk usage alerts (>80% → warning, >90% → critical)
Prevention: Automated disk cleanup scripts
Follow-up: Review all critical resources for monitoring gaps
```

### 9. Keep Services Small and Focused

**Don't**: Monolithic microservices (1000+ endpoints in one service)
```
"User Service" that also handles orders, payments, shipping
```

**Do**: Single Responsibility Principle
```
User Service: Authentication, profiles
Order Service: Order management
Payment Service: Payment processing
```

**Rule of thumb**: If it takes >30 minutes to explain a service, it's too big

### 10. Invest in Developer Experience

**Don't**: "Works on my machine" problems
```
New developer: "I spent 3 days setting up the environment"
```

**Do**: One-command setup
```bash
make dev-setup  # Installs all dependencies, seeds database, starts services
```

**SpecWeave Support**: `specweave init` sets up project structure, `.claude/` files, ready to go

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Premature Optimization

**Mistake**: Optimize before knowing if it's needed
```
Developer: "Let's cache everything! Add Redis! Use microservices!"
Result: Complexity without benefit (100 users don't need microservices)
```

**Solution**: Measure first, optimize later
```
Profile the code → Find bottleneck → Optimize that ONE thing
```

**Rule**: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth

### 2. Skipping Tests

**Mistake**: "We'll add tests later" (spoiler: you won't)
```
No tests → Code breaks → Fear of change → Technical debt
```

**Solution**: Tests are non-negotiable
```
SpecWeave: tasks.md includes test plans (80-90% coverage)
CI/CD: Blocks merges if tests fail
```

### 3. Not Planning for Failure

**Mistake**: Assume everything works perfectly
```
Payment gateway goes down → Entire checkout flow breaks
```

**Solution**: Design for failure
```
Circuit breakers (fail fast)
Fallbacks (use cached data)
Graceful degradation (show error message, allow retry)
```

### 4. Poor Error Messages

**Mistake**: Generic error messages
```
User sees: "Error 500: Internal Server Error"
Developer sees: Stack trace with no context
```

**Solution**: Actionable error messages
```
User sees: "Payment declined. Please check your card details or try another card."
Developer sees: "PaymentGatewayError: Stripe API returned 402 (insufficient_funds)"
Logs include: request ID, user ID, timestamp, stack trace
```

### 5. No Rollback Plan

**Mistake**: Deploy without a way to undo
```
Deploy v2.0 → Production breaks → "How do we rollback?"
```

**Solution**: Always have a rollback plan
```
Blue-green deployment (instant rollback by switching traffic)
Database migrations (reversible with down() function)
Feature flags (disable feature without redeploying)
```

### 6. Ignoring Security

**Mistake**: "We'll add security later"
```
Launch with no HTTPS → User passwords stolen → Lawsuit
```

**Solution**: Security from day one
```
HTTPS everywhere (TLS certificates)
Input validation (prevent SQL injection, XSS)
Authentication (JWT tokens, not session cookies)
Regular security audits (penetration testing)
```

### 7. Over-Engineering

**Mistake**: Use complex architecture for simple problems
```
TODO list app with microservices, Kafka, Kubernetes
```

**Solution**: Choose the right tool for the job
```
Small app: Monolith (Rails, Django)
Medium app: Modular monolith (separate modules, one codebase)
Large app: Microservices (when team size >50 engineers)
```

**Rule**: Start simple, split when needed (not preemptively)
