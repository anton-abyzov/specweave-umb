# Key Features

SpecWeave provides a comprehensive suite of tools and workflows for building production-grade software with AI assistance.

## ⚡ One Command = Many Prompts

**Stop dictating the same things over and over.** Every app needs auth, tests, docs, deployment - SpecWeave handles the repetitive workflows with single commands.

| What You Used To Dictate | SpecWeave Command |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| "Create spec with user stories and acceptance criteria..." | `/sw:increment "feature"` |
| "Implement this, run tests, fix failures, repeat until green..." | `/sw:auto` (runs for hours autonomously) |
| "Update GitHub issue and JIRA with my progress..." | `/sw:sync-progress` |
| "Review this code for security vulnerabilities..." | Skills auto-activate on keywords |
| "Commit everything, push, and create a PR..." | `/sw:save` |

**The expertise is built-in:**
- 68+ AI agents work in parallel (PM, Architect, QA, Security, DevOps) — powered by Claude Opus 4.6
- Skills auto-activate when you mention keywords - no need to ask for expertise
- Quality gates enforce senior dev practices automatically
- Patterns learned once become defaults everywhere

**Real-world proof**: 5 production apps built with SpecWeave. Then 10 and 14-year-old daughters learned to build apps too - because the expertise is built in, not in knowing what to ask.

## 🚀 Two Ways to Work (Flexibility for All Project Sizes)

### Interactive Quick Build

**Perfect for:** Small projects, prototypes, learning

Simply describe what you want - SpecWeave guides you through interactive prompts:

1. **Approach** - Quick build or spec-first planning
2. **Features** - Multi-select checkboxes for capabilities
3. **Tech Stack** - Choose your tools
4. **Review & Submit** - Confirm and start building

**Result:** 2 minutes from idea to working code

**Example:**
```
"build a very simple web calculator app"
→ Select features: ☑ Basic ops ☑ Keyboard ☑ History
→ Choose stack: React
→ Build! 🚀
```

### Specification-First Workflow

**Perfect for:** Production features, team projects, complex systems

Professional planning with slash commands and multi-agent coordination:

```bash
/sw:increment "user authentication"
# PM, Architect, QA agents create:
# ✅ spec.md (requirements with AC-IDs)
# ✅ plan.md (architecture + test strategy)
# ✅ tasks.md with embedded tests

/sw:do
# Implement with hooks auto-updating docs
```

**Both approaches** use the same powerful plugin system and multi-agent architecture under the hood!

## 🎯 Specification-First Development

### Append-Only Snapshots + Living Documentation

**SpecWeave's Core Power**: Maintains both historical audit trails and current documentation simultaneously.

**The Innovation**: Unlike traditional documentation that gets outdated or loses historical context, SpecWeave gives you BOTH:

#### 📸 Append-Only Increment Snapshots (Historical Context)
```
.specweave/increments/
├── 0001-user-authentication/
│   ├── spec.md              # What was planned (AC-IDs)
│   ├── plan.md              # How it was built + test strategy
│   ├── tasks.md             # What was done + embedded tests
│   └── logs/                # Execution history
├── 0002-oauth-integration/  # Extends/modifies 0001
└── 0003-password-reset/     # Related feature
```

**Never modified after completion** - Complete audit trail of every feature built.

#### 📄 Living Up-to-Date Documentation (Current State)
```
.specweave/docs/
├── internal/
│   ├── strategy/      # WHAT and WHY (PRDs, user stories)
│   ├── architecture/  # HOW (system design, ADRs, RFCs)
│   ├── delivery/      # Roadmap, release plans
│   ├── operations/    # Runbooks, SLOs, monitoring
│   └── governance/    # Security, compliance
└── public/            # Customer-facing documentation
```

**Auto-updated after each task** - Always reflects current code state.

### Why This Matters

| Problem | Traditional Approach | SpecWeave Solution |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **"Why did we do it this way?"** | Context lost, tribal knowledge | Read historical increment snapshots |
| **"What's the current architecture?"** | Docs outdated | Living docs auto-updated |
| **"What changed in this feature?"** | [Git](/docs/glossary/terms/git) commits only | Complete increment snapshot with spec, plan, tests |
| **"Prove compliance"** | Reconstruct from memory | Complete audit trail in increments |
| **"Onboard new developer"** | Days of reading code | Read current docs + historical increments |

### Real-World Benefits

- **Compliance-Ready**: [SOC 2](/docs/glossary/terms/soc2), [HIPAA](/docs/glossary/terms/hipaa), [FDA](/docs/glossary/terms/fda) audits have complete paper trail
- **Context Recovery**: Understand decisions made 6 months ago
- **Impact Analysis**: See all related changes by searching increments
- **Rollback Intelligence**: Know exactly what to revert
- **Knowledge Transfer**: No tribal knowledge silos
- **Debugging**: Trace feature evolution across increments

**Think of it as "[Git](/docs/glossary/terms/git) for Specifications"**:
- Increments = commits (immutable snapshots)
- Living docs = working directory (current state)
- Both essential, both version controlled

### 5-Pillar Documentation Structure

Living documentation organized by purpose:

## 🧠 Context Precision (70%+ Token Reduction)

### Progressive Disclosure (Native Claude)

SpecWeave uses Claude's native progressive disclosure mechanism - no RAG or vector databases needed:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Always visible reference with living docs locations
- **Skills**: Metadata loads first (~75 tokens), full content on-demand
- **Living Docs Navigator**: Built-in skill that teaches Claude WHERE to look and HOW to search
- **Explicit Loading**: `/sw:docs <topic>` loads relevant docs into conversation

### How It Works

```
User: "Implement user authentication"
         ↓
Claude reads CLAUDE.md (always loaded)
         ↓
Sees: "Before implementing: Check existing docs"
         ↓
Searches: grep -ril "auth" .specweave/docs/internal/
         ↓
Finds: ADRs, specs, architecture docs
         ↓
Reads only relevant files
         ↓
Implements with full context
```

**Why Not RAG?** Progressive disclosure is simpler, cheaper, and more accurate:
- No vector DB infrastructure
- No embedding approximations - reads actual content
- No index staleness - always current files
- Zero cost - native Claude capability

**Result**: Load exactly what's needed, save 70%+ on AI costs.

→ Generates complete spec + architecture + plan
\`\`\`

## 🔌 Skills Are Programs in English

**Skills are not prompts — they are reusable programs written in English.** Each skill controls how AI thinks, decides, and acts for a specific domain. 100+ skills ship with SpecWeave.

SpecWeave applies the **SOLID Open/Closed Principle** to these human-language programs:

- **SKILL.md** = core program (closed for modification — stable, tested, version-controlled)
- **skill-memories/*.md** = your extensions (open for extension — your rules, your patterns)

Claude reads both at runtime. Your extensions override defaults. The original skill keeps getting updates. You never have merge conflicts.

**Example:**
```markdown
# .specweave/skill-memories/frontend.md

### Form Handling
- Use React Hook Form for all forms
- Combine with Zod for validation schemas

### Component Rules
When generating components:
1. Check design system first (src/components/ui/)
2. If component exists, import it — don't recreate
3. Extract to custom hooks if logic >50 lines
```

You correct Claude once. It remembers forever. That's not configuration — that's **programming the AI in English**.

| Tool | Can You Customize AI Behavior? |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **SpecWeave** | Yes — extend via skill-memories (SOLID Open/Closed) |
| **ChatGPT** | Text box. No structure. Resets per conversation |
| **GitHub Copilot** | No — black box reasoning |
| **Cursor** | No — proprietary, locked logic |

**Enable auto-learning:** `/sw:reflect-on` captures corrections as permanent skill-memories.

See [Skills Are Programs in English](/docs/overview/skills-as-programs) for a full overview, [Extensible Skills deep-dive](/docs/guides/extensible-skills) for customization patterns, and [Philosophy: Open/Closed Principle](/docs/overview/philosophy#5-extensible-skills-openclosed-principle) for design principles.

## 🧪 Test-Validated Development

### Test-Aware Planning

1. **Specification Acceptance Criteria** (AC-ID format: AC-US1-01)
   - Business-level acceptance criteria in spec.md
   - Technology-agnostic validation
   - Linked to user stories

2. **Embedded Test Plans** (tasks)
   - [BDD](/docs/glossary/terms/bdd) format (Given/When/Then) per task
   - Maps AC-IDs to test implementations
   - Coverage targets (80-90% per task)

3. **Skill Test Cases** (YAML-based)
   - Minimum 3 tests per skill
   - Structured validation

4. **Code Tests** (Automated)
   - [E2E](/docs/glossary/terms/e2e) with Playwright (MANDATORY for UI)
   - Unit and integration tests
   - >80% coverage for critical paths

### Truth-Telling Requirement

[E2E](/docs/glossary/terms/e2e) tests MUST tell the truth:
- ✅ If test passes → feature actually works
- ✅ If test fails → exactly what failed
- ❌ No false positives
- ❌ No masking failures

## 📊 Mermaid Diagrams (C4 Model)

### Architecture Visualization

SpecWeave uses the **C4 Model** for architecture diagrams:

- **C4-1: Context** - System boundaries, external actors
- **C4-2: Container** - Applications, services, databases
- **C4-3: Component** - Internal structure
- **C4-4: Code** - Class diagrams (optional)

### Example Diagram

\`\`\`mermaid

### [WIP Limits](/docs/glossary/terms/wip-limits)

Prevent context-switching:
- **Solo/small teams**: 1-2 in progress
- **Large teams**: 3-5 in progress
- **Force override**: Available but discouraged

## 🔗 External Tool Sync (GitHub/JIRA/ADO)

**No Tool Lock-in**: SpecWeave integrates with your existing project management tools. Keep your workflow—just add specifications.

### Why This Matters

| Problem | Without SpecWeave | With SpecWeave |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Team uses JIRA** | Abandon JIRA or maintain two systems | Specs push to JIRA, status reads back |
| **GitHub Issues workflow** | Manual updates, drift | Auto-sync progress to issues |
| **Azure DevOps enterprise** | Complex migration | Native integration, no disruption |
| **Multiple tools** | Constant context switching | SpecWeave syncs to all |

### GitHub Issues Sync
```bash
/sw-github:sync
```
- **Milestones** ↔ Release Plans
- **Issues** ↔ User Stories/Tasks with checkable subtasks
- **Progress** auto-updates as tasks complete
- **Labels** auto-generated from increment metadata

### JIRA Sync
```bash
/sw-jira:sync
```
- **Content sync** - specs push to JIRA, status reads back
- **Epics** ↔ Features/Increments
- **Stories** ↔ User Stories (PRDs/RFCs)
- **Tasks** ↔ Tasks with AC-ID mapping

### Azure DevOps Sync
```bash
/sw-ado:sync
```
- **4-level hierarchy** support (Epics → Features → User Stories → Tasks)
- **Area Paths** and **Iterations** mapping
- **Work item synchronization** with status updates
- **Enterprise-ready** with PAT authentication

### Key Benefits

1. **Keep Your Workflow** - Teams continue using familiar tools
2. **Single Source of Truth** - Specs drive everything, tools reflect state
3. **Auto-Sync Progress** - Complete a task → issue updates automatically
4. **Gradual Adoption** - Start with one project, expand when ready
5. **Audit Trail** - All syncs logged in increment metadata

## 🏢 [Brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield) Excellence (The Hardest Problem Solved)

### Why [Brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield) is Most Complicated

Brownfield projects are the **ultimate challenge** in software development:

- ❌ Existing codebase with **zero or outdated documentation**

- ❌ **Tribal knowledge** scattered across team members

- ❌ **Risk of breaking production** with every change

- ❌ Need to **merge with existing docs, wikis, Confluence pages**

- ❌ **Complex architecture** that was never properly documented

- ❌ **Living documentation** that stays current as code evolves

**Most tools give up here. SpecWeave excels.**

### Intelligent Documentation Merging

SpecWeave's **[brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield)-onboarder** skill intelligently consolidates existing documentation:

```bash
"Read brownfield-onboarder skill and merge my existing docs/"
```

**What it does:**

- 📄 **Extracts knowledge** from existing docs, wikis, Confluence, legacy CLAUDE.md

- 🧠 **Preserves context** - historical decisions, team conventions, domain knowledge

- 📁 **Distributes intelligently** - routes content to appropriate SpecWeave folders
  - Strategy docs → `.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/`
  - Architecture → `.specweave/docs/internal/architecture/`
  - Operations → `.specweave/docs/internal/operations/`

- 🎯 **No bloat** - smart organization without polluting CLAUDE.md

### Retroactive Architecture Documentation

Create comprehensive architecture for **existing systems** without disrupting production:

```bash
"Analyze authentication module and create complete architecture docs"
```

**SpecWeave generates:**

#### High-Level Design (HLD)

- System architecture overview

- Component relationships

- Data flow diagrams

- Integration points

#### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

- **[ADR](/docs/glossary/terms/adr)-0001**: Why we chose JWT over sessions

- **ADR-0002**: OAuth 2.0 provider selection rationale

- **ADR-0003**: Token refresh strategy

- Status: Accepted (for existing patterns) or Proposed (for changes)

#### C4 Model Diagrams

- **C4-1 Context**: System boundaries, external actors

- **C4-2 Container**: Services, databases, APIs

- **C4-3 Component**: Internal module structure

- **Sequence Diagrams**: Login flow, token refresh, logout

- **ER Diagrams**: User, Session, Token data models

**Example:**
```bash
"Create complete architecture documentation for auth system"
# Generates:
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/hld-authentication.md
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/0001-jwt-tokens.md
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/adr/0002-oauth-provider.md
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/diagrams/auth-context.c4.mmd
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/diagrams/auth-container.c4.mmd
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/diagrams/auth-component.c4.mmd
# - .specweave/docs/internal/architecture/diagrams/login-sequence.mmd
```

### Living Documentation That Never Gets Stale

The **killer feature** for [brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield): documentation that **auto-updates** as code evolves.

**How it works:**

1. **Initial Documentation** - SpecWeave creates complete specs, HLDs, ADRs, diagrams

2. **Code Changes** - You modify code using `/sw:do`

3. **Auto-Update** - Hooks automatically update:
   - Specifications reflect new requirements
   - ADRs move from Proposed → Accepted
   - Architecture diagrams update with new components
   - HLDs reflect current system state
   - RFCs document new patterns

4. **Always Current** - Documentation never drifts from code

**Technologies:**

- **Claude Hooks** - Post-task-completion hook runs after every task

- **Living Docs Sync** - `/sw:sync-docs update` propagates changes

- **Version Control** - All docs in [Git](/docs/glossary/terms/git), full history preserved

### Structure Evolution and Maintenance

As your [brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield) project grows, SpecWeave **grows the documentation structure**:

**Scenario: Adding new payment module**
```bash
/sw:increment "payment processing module"
```

**SpecWeave automatically:**

1. Creates new strategy docs: `.specweave/docs/internal/strategy/payments/`

2. Generates architecture docs with ADRs

3. Links to existing auth system (dependency tracking)

4. Updates system-level HLD to include payment module

5. Adds payment module to C4 Container diagram

6. Creates RFCs for new patterns

7. Maintains incremental history in `.specweave/increments/`

**Result:** Your documentation structure **organically evolves** with your codebase.

### Regression Prevention (Safety First)

Before modifying **any existing code**, SpecWeave enforces safety:

1. ✅ **Analyze current implementation**
   - Reads existing code
   - Maps dependencies
   - Identifies integration points

2. ✅ **Generate retroactive specifications**
   - Documents current behavior (WHAT/WHY)
   - Creates architecture docs (HOW)
   - Maps data flows

3. ✅ **Create baseline tests**
   - Captures current behavior in tests
   - Prevents accidental regression
   - Serves as living documentation

4. ✅ **Impact analysis**
   - Dependency graph generation
   - Affected modules identification
   - Risk assessment

5. ✅ **User review and approval**
   - You review generated docs
   - Approve changes before implementation

6. ✅ **Safe implementation**
   - Modify code with confidence
   - Baseline tests catch regressions
   - Living docs stay current

### Real-World [Brownfield](/docs/glossary/terms/brownfield) Scenario

**Before SpecWeave:**
```
Existing Project Problems:
❌ 50K+ lines of code, zero documentation
❌ Original developers left, tribal knowledge lost
❌ Need to add OAuth, terrified of breaking login
❌ Scattered docs in Confluence, wikis, old READMEs
❌ Architecture decisions unknown
❌ Every change risks production
```

**After SpecWeave:**
```bash
# Day 1: Initialize and merge
npx specweave init .
"Merge existing Confluence docs and wiki pages"
# ✅ All knowledge consolidated in SpecWeave structure

# Day 2: Document existing auth
"Analyze authentication module and create full documentation"
# ✅ HLDs, ADRs, C4 diagrams generated
# ✅ Current implementation fully documented

# Day 3: Create baseline tests
"Create comprehensive tests for current auth behavior"
# ✅ Regression prevention in place

# Day 4: Add OAuth safely
/sw:increment "Add OAuth 2.0 support"
/sw:do
# ✅ OAuth added with:
#    - Updated specs and ADRs
#    - Extended architecture diagrams
#    - Baseline tests prevent regression
#    - Living docs auto-updated

# Day 5 onward: Maintain forever
# ✅ Every change auto-updates documentation
# ✅ Architecture diagrams always current
# ✅ ADRs reflect actual decisions
# ✅ No documentation drift ever
```
